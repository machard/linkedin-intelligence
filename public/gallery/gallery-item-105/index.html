Some call it belief. Others just call it gullibility, meticulously scripted block by block. <br /><br />If your financial freedom depends on code that never bends, ask yourself—are you resonating, or just repeating?<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#Bitcoin <br />hashtag<br />#gullible <br />hashtag<br />#digitalgold <br />hashtag<br />#beliefsystems <br />hashtag<br />#resonance</h1>
