  <h1>🔻 Now Streaming Bitcoin Zero Down &gt; The year is 2032. Satoshi’s ghost is missing. Taproot’s still propagating, but the blocks are empty. What happened?  In a cinematic reckoning unlike anything Bitcoiners were prepared for, Bitcoin Zero Down confronts the hyperstitions buried under number go up. The hash rate is high—but so is entropy. As Ethereum forks unlock Eigen sublayers and restake consensus bleeds into biological meshnets, one question remains unasked in the citadel  What if Bitcoin became the most expensive hallucination humanity ever crowdsourced?  In this chilling speculative docuthriller, we trace the recursive loop of rigid ossification, maximalist dogma, and the silent accumulation of latency within Nakamoto’s time capsule. Flashbacks of failed soft forks. Flashforwards of memetic obsolescence. Everything you ignored… awakens.  🎞️ Starring a disappearing block subsidy, a frictionless adversary network, and the haunting glow of relevance lost in proofofwork limbo.  &gt; “Immutability is not integrity when reality keeps changing.”  Brace yourself. Because obsolescence isnt a bug. Its a block.  cc Ethereum Foundation Eigen Labs Morpho a16z speedrun Strategy Tether.io CoinDesk Capital Union Bank Tenet Bank CoinDesk franceinfo Ledger Eric Wall Pascal Gauthier Sandy Peng Antonio Sabado Nethermind</h1>
