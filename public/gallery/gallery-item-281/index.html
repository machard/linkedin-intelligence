  <h1>What if “madness” was not a glitch but a recalibration?  A moment when the dominant frequency no longer holds, and the system bends toward a new resonance.  In many cultures, to “lose touch with reality” wasn’t always pathology — it was passage. A rite. A breakdown of linear cognition that allowed for immersion in spirals, patterns, and rhythms too subtle for dominant paradigms to perceive.  Today, these nonnormative states are often compressed into silence, medicated into compliance. But what if they were signals? Invitations to retune not only the self, but the collective operating system?  I don’t romanticize suffering. But I resist the systemic reflex to erase what it does not understand. The madness I speak of is not disorder — its a divergence that reveals the need for systemic resonance.  Call it a fracture. Or a portal. But don’t call it nonsense.</h1>
