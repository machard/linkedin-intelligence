  <h1>Temporal Epistemology Knowing in the Flow  What if “truth” isn’t a frozen object to be discovered, but a pattern that stays in sync across time?  In this lens, knowledge isn’t about static facts—it’s about rhythms that cohere, reverberate, and persist. Just like a melody that returns with enough variation to stay alive, what we call “real” is what continues resonating across shifting observers, perceptions, and frames.  Temporal Epistemology says Don’t ask “is this objectively true?” Ask Does it remain aligned as everything else shifts?  Because in a liquid world—where systems evolve, observers fluctuate in scale, and signals distort—the only sustainable signal is the one that dances with time and doesn’t drift.  Not absolute. But enduring. Not fixed. But phaselocked.  And maybe that’s enough.</h1>
