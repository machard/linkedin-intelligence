  <h1>🔐 Closed Cognitive Loop 2: “Decentralization = Absolute Good”<br /><br />🔁 Loop Explanation: Within Bitcoin’s worldview, decentralization isn’t just a feature—it’s elevated to a moral axiom. The narrative runs: “Because Bitcoin is decentralized, it is incorruptible. Any deviation is corruption.”<br /><br />But here’s where the loop tightens:<br />- Mining centralization? Brushed aside with “Still better than fiat.”<br />- Developer gatekeeping? Dismissed as necessary stewardship.<br />- Lack of user governance? Framed as a strength, not a fragility.<br /><br />This creates selective blindness: centralization within Bitcoin is tolerated or rationalized as long as it doesn’t challenge the broader narrative. Even factual critiques are recast as anti-decentralization or anti-Bitcoin. The ideal becomes self-defending, regardless of reality.<br /><br />Over time, decentralization becomes less a method of organizing trust—and more a shibboleth for tribal belonging.</h1>
