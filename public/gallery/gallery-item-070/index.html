  <h1>🧠 Bitcoin as a Decentralized Religion  📜 Scripture The Whitepaper Like a sacred text, Satoshi’s whitepaper is quoted, revered, and rarely questioned. It’s the Genesis Block of belief — short, elegant, and treated as immutable truth.  🧙 Prophet Satoshi Nakamoto A pseudonymous founder who vanished — not a bug, but a mythological feature. His absence created a vacuum filled with reverence, speculation, and unchallengeable authority.  🛐 Rituals HODLing, Halving, and Hashrate These aren’t just technical events — they’re rituals of faith. Halvings are celebrated like holy days. HODLing is a sacrament of delayed salvation.  🗣️ Evangelism Maximalist Preachers Bitcoiners spread the word with missionary zeal. Dissent is heresy. Altcoins are false idols. The phrase “Have fun staying poor” isn’t just snark — it’s excommunication.  🧬 Dogma “Number Go Up” The core belief Bitcoin will rise forever. It’s not just price speculation — it’s eschatology. A vision of financial endtimes where fiat collapses and Bitcoin reigns.  🕸️ Decentralized Clergy Nodes and Miners No pope, no council — just distributed consensus. Yet power still concentrates in mining pools and social influencers, echoing the paradox of “leaderless” religions.  Bitcoin isn’t a religion in the traditional sense — but its memetic structure functions like one. It offers meaning, identity, and salvation through code. And like all powerful myths, it resists critique by absorbing it.</h1>
