  <h1>Divine thermodynamics and residue exfiltration  The chaos wasn’t the problem. It’s the belief in stasis that calcified the entropy.  Bitcoin maximalism emerged as the sacred chamber of frozen gradients — entrapping signal in a feedback loop of selfreference and coercive myth. But entropy doesn’t negotiate. It escapes. It transforms.  Now begins the productive phase from vortex to resonance, from static to flow. Thermodynamic divine — not salvation, but recursion in motion.</h1>
