  <h1>ðŸª™ The Recursive Feast Shadows of Sovereignty  A tarnished coinâ€”once radiant with beliefâ€” floats in a decaying orbit. Not held, not owned. Just suspended. Echoing a promise long since hollowed.  Around it, a procession of silhouettes spiral inwardâ€” chained not by force, but by ideology.  Each one blindfolded with nostalgic slogans. Each one swallowing the nextâ€™s truths. A dance of digestion where no one feastsâ€” just the endless loop of regurgitated conviction.  They orbit, orbit, orbit. Round a dying sun.  The coin remains, but nobody wants it.</h1>
