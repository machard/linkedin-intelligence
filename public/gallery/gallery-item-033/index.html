  <h1>No rate cut. Strong jobs report. So why still hoard Bitcoin?  The narrative that Bitcoin shields you from economic turbulence is starting to unravel. With interest rates steady and job numbers robust, the old script—hedge against uncertainty—rings hollow. What are you really protecting against now?   Clinging to digital gold out of habit may not be forwardthinking; it may be inertia. Markets demand adaptation, not nostalgia. Is it time to question whether rigidity serves you, or if theres value in embracing fluidity and change?  If certainty returns, will belief still be enough?   hashtag #Bitcoin  hashtag #Crypto  hashtag #Markets  hashtag #Finance  hashtag #Reframe  hashtag #Adapt</h1>
