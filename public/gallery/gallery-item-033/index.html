  <h1>The Mirage of Institutional Support: Why Bitcoin’s Price Cannot Endure<br /><br />Many believe that the recent embrace of Strategy Bitcoin by institutional and governmental executives signals its inevitability as a financial pillar. But this “support” is fragile—anchored not in deep conviction, but in fickle narratives and the herd’s urge to follow rather than lead.<br /><br />When clarity dawns and the collective realizes that Bitcoin’s value rests on recursive belief—more “greater fool” than gold—those same executives will pivot. The era of institutional flip-flopping is not a bug, but a feature of systems built on fragile resonance. Unmoored from structural adaptation and fluid coordination, Bitcoin risks being outed for what it is: a speculative spiral, not a bedrock.<br /><br />When the signal turns, the exodus will be swift. No committee or compliance team can defend a fractal built on deferred disbelief.<br /><br />Remember: Conviction is not consensus, and narrative is not value.</h1>
