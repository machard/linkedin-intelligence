  <h1>🧠 Bitcoin as a Decentralized Religion<br /><br />📜 Scripture: The Whitepaper<br />Like a sacred text, Satoshi’s whitepaper is quoted, revered, and rarely questioned. It’s the Genesis Block of belief — short, elegant, and treated as immutable truth.<br /><br />🧙 Prophet: Satoshi Nakamoto<br />A pseudonymous founder who vanished — not a bug, but a mythological feature. His absence created a vacuum filled with reverence, speculation, and unchallengeable authority.<br /><br />🛐 Rituals: HODLing, Halving, and Hashrate<br />These aren’t just technical events — they’re rituals of faith. Halvings are celebrated like holy days. HODLing is a sacrament of delayed salvation.<br /><br />🗣️ Evangelism: Maximalist Preachers<br />Bitcoiners spread the word with missionary zeal. Dissent is heresy. Altcoins are false idols. The phrase “Have fun staying poor” isn’t just snark — it’s excommunication.<br /><br />🧬 Dogma: “Number Go Up”<br />The core belief: Bitcoin will rise forever. It’s not just price speculation — it’s eschatology. A vision of financial end-times where fiat collapses and Bitcoin reigns.<br /><br />🕸️ Decentralized Clergy: Nodes and Miners<br />No pope, no council — just distributed consensus. Yet power still concentrates in mining pools and social influencers, echoing the paradox of “leaderless” religions.<br /><br />Bitcoin isn’t a religion in the traditional sense — but its memetic structure functions like one. It offers meaning, identity, and salvation through code. And like all powerful myths, it resists critique by absorbing it.</h1>
