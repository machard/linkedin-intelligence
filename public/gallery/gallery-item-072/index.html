  <h1>🧠 Post “How Ethereum Helped Me Debug Bitcoin”  I didn’t break Bitcoin by attacking it. I debugged it — with Ethereum as my lens.  Where Bitcoin demanded belief, Ethereum offered logic. Smart contracts, modularity, coordination layers — they showed me what could be.  I saw Bitcoin’s rigidity. Its tribal architecture. Its mythological loops.  Ethereum didn’t just make sense. It made Bitcoin’s flaws visible. Like shining fluid light on ossified code.  I never was a maximalist. I was a systems thinker. And Ethereum gave me the tools to see through the shell.  Now I don’t reject Bitcoin. I understand it. And that’s how I rewrote the script.</h1>
