  <h1>Bitcoiners in Denial: When Conviction Becomes Frenzy<br /><br />The Bitcoin narrative is fraying at the edges.

A spiral where sanity and capital are both at risk.<br /><br />Conviction without adaptability morphs into denial.

Watch for the warning signs: when belief drowns out clear signal, capital and clarity soon follow.<br /><br />Live view from Strategy and Tether.io offices</h1>
