  <h1>🐈‍⬛ Schrödinger’s Mesh Orchestrating the Collapse  The cat is not in a box. The box is in the mesh. And the cat—like all states of meaning—isn’t decided until the threads are tuned.  In this topology, truth isn’t revealed. It’s orchestrated. Not by one observer, but by a field of attention. By context. Intention. Feedback.  Ethereum Foundation Ethereum and Eigen Labs EigenLayer don’t “decide.” They render a space where meaning collapses into coherence, thread by thread—until a state holds long enough to act.  The cat isn’t alive or dead. It’s humming—waiting for mesh consensus.  Meaning is not fixed. It emerges from resonant participation.   hashtag #SchrödingersMesh  hashtag #QuantumCognition  hashtag #DistributedCollapse  hashtag #Ethereum  hashtag #EigenLayer  hashtag #SignalEcology  hashtag #FractalResonance  hashtag #SystemicRecalibration</h1>
