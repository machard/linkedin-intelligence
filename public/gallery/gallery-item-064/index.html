  <h1>ðŸš¨ Web3 isnâ€™t about tokens. Itâ€™s about trust topology.  Ethereum is the substrate. ETH is the energy. EigenLayer is the synaptic mesh. AVSs are modular cognition. Validators are intelligent agents. L2s are expressive limbs. Altchains are detached lobes.  Weâ€™re not building apps â€” weâ€™re assembling a fractal brain. Web3 is not a product stack. Itâ€™s a shared trust organism, emerging through selective attention, recursive restaking, and dynamic coherence.  Stop optimizing for hype cycles. Start tuning for resonance.   hashtag #Web3  hashtag #Ethereum  hashtag #EigenLayer  hashtag #Restaking  hashtag #Decentralization  hashtag #SystemicThinking  hashtag #SignalEcology  hashtag #FractalCognition  cc Ethereum Foundation Eigen Labs Morpho  cc Arbitrum Optimism Foundation</h1>
