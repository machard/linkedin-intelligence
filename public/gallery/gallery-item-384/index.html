  <h1>ðŸª“ What is a disaster in Bitcoin world?  1. Hyperfinancialization  Too many believers are just in it for numbergoup.  Custodial services dominate. Most donâ€™t selfcustody.  Bitcoin ETFs and corporate stacking (e.g. MicroStrategy) shift power away from the original ethos of peertopeer cash.  2. Stagnant baselayer development  Some treat protocol ossification as dogma.  Good ideas (like covenants, drivechains, or better privacy tools) get stonewalled for political reasons.  Innovation is outsourced to Layer 2s, many of which are centralized or immature.  3. Toxic maximalism  It often devolves into purity tests, tribalism, and attacking everything nonBitcoin â€” especially Ethereum.  This drives out thoughtful people who mightâ€™ve helped fix the culture.  Itâ€™s more about identity performance than open discourse now.  4. Overconcentration of mining &amp; wealth  A lot of mining remains in jurisdictions that are not exactly profreedom.  Early whales, custodians, and corporate giants now hold disproportionate sway over perception and liquidity.  5. Retail sidelined  Most people donâ€™t use Bitcoin â€” they speculate on it.  Payments? Rare. Circular economies? Niche.  Lightning is promising, but underused and still clunky for many.</h1>
