  <h1>🚨 Pre-Alpha Protocol™ — “Lighting the Universe Three Seconds Early”<br />> “Why wait for reality when you can front-run existence?”<br /><br />✨ Manifesto (leaked v0.0001-alpha-minus): We are not building a product. We are unveiling a vibration. Time is optional. Consensus is suggestive. We do not sync with the universe— The universe syncs with us.<br /><br />🌀 Tech Stack:<br />- Quantum vibesheets<br />- Zero-knowledge luminance<br />- Proof of Feeling<br />- Recursive Light Amplification Modules (RLAMs)<br />- All running on FractalChain v0 (now deprecated but spiritually relevant)<br /><br />🔮 Roadmap:<br />- Q0: Community dreams the whitepaper into existence<br />- Q1: Retroactively raise seed funding from future selves<br />- Q2: Launch an invisible testnet (undetectable by design)<br />- Q3: Distribute genesis tokens telepathically<br />- Q4: Trigger cosmic alignment via coordinated breathing<br /><br />🌐 Governance: Run by the Council of Seven-and-a-Half Anons, each chosen through vibrational resonance and one highly obscure emoji contest.<br /><br />📝 Disclaimers: Not responsible for unintentional enlightenment, spontaneous resonance, or flash mobs of synchronized dancing.</h1>
