  <h1>Module 10: Cognitive Scripting<br /><br />Thought isn't freeform. It's scaffolded.<br /><br />Cognitive Scripting is how systems embed thought templates— before you realize you're following one.<br /><br />→ Predictive text. → Suggestion engines. → Thought-terminating clichés. → Algorithmic language framing.<br /><br />These aren’t just tools. They’re epistemic scaffolds. You’re nudged not just what to say— but how to think about what you're saying.<br /><br />X becomes the stage where scripts battle for primacy: → Virality becomes authority. → Repetition becomes consensus. → Language narrows until nuance feels obsolete.<br /><br />We don’t repeat these scripts because they’re true. We repeat them because they’re available, cached in the culture, tuned for speed.<br /><br />But real thinking resists prefab cognition. It wanders. It contradicts itself. It listens for what doesn’t fit the script.<br /><br />True thought is unscripted. Train your inner narrator to improvise.</h1>
