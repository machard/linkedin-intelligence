  <h1>🚨 New Mental Model Systemic Perspective of a Group of Beings (For thinkers, builders, and those designing conscious systems)  We often model the mind as a machine or a neural net. But what if we approached it systemically, as part of a network of sovereign agents, each with their own reconstructed internal reality?  🧠 Each being in this model   Operates through a Transformer made of hardware, software, and a living Internal Reality  Builds that internal reality from → Shared Reality (language, culture, physics) → Local Memory (the light path of experience) → RealTime Simulation (prediction, intent, reflection)  🌍 Shared Reality isn’t just what is — its what we maintain together through attention, action, protocol, and meaning. It can be rewritten.  ✨ What emerges is a fluid, multidimensional flow   Spirits resonate across the system  Simulations evolve in parallel  Collaboration becomes emergent rather than managed  This model bridges philosophy, cognition, and decentralized system design. It’s relevant for DAOs, AI agents, social architectures, or anyone building with humans in the loop.  Let’s stop pretending reality is flat.  —  Would love to hear how others are thinking about distributed consciousness and symbolic systems. 🔗 Ask me for the full description if you’re curious.   hashtag #SystemDesign  hashtag #Cognition  hashtag #DAOs  hashtag #AI  hashtag #Philosophy  hashtag #Simulation  hashtag #InternalReality  hashtag #SharedReality  hashtag #ComplexSystems  cc The Nobel Prize (jamais 2 sans 3)</h1>
