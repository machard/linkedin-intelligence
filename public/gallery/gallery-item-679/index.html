  <h1>Europe is a soft empire in slow decay. Not really in crisis. Not really alive either.  1. Economically organized stagnation  Europe survives on monetary life support. Low growth, massive debt, a central bank on autopilot. The euro sustains an artificial balance between structurally incompatible countries. Even Germany is running out of steam.  2. Politically schizophrenia  Nationstates talk sovereignty, but hand it over to faceless technocracy. Democracy is the showroom. The real decisions happen elsewhere — in committees, regulations, and opaque treaties.  3. Socially collective fatigue  An aging population, crushing taxes, growing identity stress. Young people check out — through emigration, ideology, or digital escape. The social contract no longer offers a future. It just manages decline.  4. Geopolitically obsolescence  No strategic autonomy. Military outsourced to the U.S. via NATO. Europe regulates while the rest of the world builds.  Europe is Byzantium before the Turks. Elegant, moralizing, administrative — but unable to defend itself or reinvent its purpose.  It still believes in its own stories. But it has lost its vital energy.  https//lnkd.in/edxNG4m</h1>
