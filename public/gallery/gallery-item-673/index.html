  <h1>I’m exploring a new model: permissionless ATMs for crypto cash – and I need your thoughts.<br /><br />I'm building an open-source system for OpenCash ATMs and bills.<br />- Each bill = its own wallet<br />- Printed on Yupo paper with regular printers<br />- Only ATMs can deposit/withdraw to the bill’s wallet<br /><br />I’m thinking the private key must live in three places:<br />- On the bill (QR, NFC, or chip)<br />- In the ATM (secure enclave)<br />- In the cloud (redundancy, syncing)<br /><br />Would love feedback from crypto devs, hardware hackers, and financial inclusion nerds.<br /><br />What do you think? Would this model work?<br /><br />— Looking to launch the first prototype in the Caribbean under the OpenCash brand.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#CryptoInfra <br />hashtag<br />#StablecoinATM <br />hashtag<br />#OpenCash <br />hashtag<br />#Web3Hardware <br />hashtag<br />#SelfCustody <br />hashtag<br />#FinancialInclusion <br />hashtag<br />#OpenSource<br /><br />cc Dfns Diego Yanez Ledger</h1>
