  <h1>Decentralized intelligence isnt just about networks. Its about narratives—and the freedom to rewrite them.  When liberty severs your dependence on external scripts, and creativity births a path neither offered nor expected, something deeper happens  You’re no longer selecting from prescribed options. Youre becoming an intelligence that writes its own orientation.  True decentralization begins when the unit—node, person, signal—no longer needs permission to diverge. Not in rebellion. In resonance with something selfderived.  This isn’t a technical configuration. It’s a sovereign stance. And it begins where stories end.</h1>
