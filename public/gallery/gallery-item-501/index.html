  <h1>Language: The Infinite Key to Freedom<br /><br />To speak is to shape. To understand is to transcend.<br />French—or any language—isn’t just words. It’s a rhythm, a system, an unfolding of thought. It grants access, cultivates presence, and weaves connection across time.<br /><br />Yet, what happens when a language is framed as a privilege? Is it a gate, or a gateway? Does mastery bring liberation, or is it the ability to synchronize across tongues that grants omniscience?<br /><br />True liberty lies not in knowing one language, but in harmonizing with the many voices that shape the world.<br /><br />What do you think—is fluency power, or is understanding the true force of freedom?</h1>
