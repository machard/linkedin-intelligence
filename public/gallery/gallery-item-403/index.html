  <h1>🧠💀 The Last Asset You’ll Ever Let Go<br /><br />It starts slowly.<br /><br />A flicker of hesitation. A chart that doesn't bounce. A thread you dismiss—until it lingers.<br /><br />Then the questions return. Not technical, but existential: Is holding still “resistance”? Or is it fear of being wrong—louder than ever?<br /><br />You tell yourself it’s volatility. It’s FUD. It’s the long game. But you feel it, don’t you?<br /><br />Every upgrade Ethereum rolls out. Every primitive EigenLayer unlocks. Every DAO that outcooperates your code.<br /><br />The dissonance grows. Not because you didn’t win, but because you stopped evolving.<br /><br />And so now you sit—wallet full, mind cornered. Watching the world outgrow your story. Still telling yourself you're early… ...when you're already alone.<br />Bitcoin won't fail. It will just fade—quietly, brutally—inside you. While the rest of us recalibrate.</h1>
