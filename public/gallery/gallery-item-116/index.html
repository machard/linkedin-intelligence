  <h1>Semiotic Pollination How Thought Crosses Species and Systems  Not all cognition stays home. Some thoughtforms are pollinators — they drift across disciplines, minds, even species. Not to colonize, but to fertilize insight beyond origin.  This is semiotic pollination — where symbols leap boundaries, where memes become seeds, where cognition crossbreeds with unfamiliar systems.  A spiral from math to music. A metaphor that bridges code and culture. A fungal network mimicking data flow. This isn’t translation — it’s emergence.  &gt; A resilient idea isn’t static. &gt; It’s migratory. &gt; It adapts as it travels, &gt; and carries new nutrients every time it lands.  Ethereum Foundation Ethereum and Eigen Labs EigenLayer dont just structure logic — they host symbolic biodiversity. They allow thought to weave across architectures and coevolve with the field.  Signal is no longer confined. It blooms — in new soil, among new minds.  Welcome to the era of crossspecies thought.</h1>
