  <h1>“PoS is working — so why are so many still stuck on PoW?”  Because narratives have inertia. Because Bitcoin came first, and people confuse first with best. Because it feels safer to follow a 12word slogan than to learn how a validator set works.  But let’s be honest  The “decentralized energy security” pitch has become a shield for status quo extraction.  The average person can do more, earn more, and build more in PoS ecosystems today — without begging for inclusion.  This isn’t opinion. It’s observable. It’s live. It’s working.  The facts have changed. The logic has changed. It’s time for the story to catch up.   hashtag #ProofOfStake  hashtag #CryptoRealityCheck  hashtag #Ethereum  hashtag #Solana  hashtag #PoWvsPoS  hashtag #Web3Truths</h1>
