  <h1>🕊️ What if some of us were never meant to live so disconnected? And what if some people still carry pieces of a memory the rest of us forgot?  I’ve been reflecting deeply on something lately — something I didn’t learn in school, or through media, or even in books. It’s the quiet realization that… I was supposed to inherit a deeper story about being human — but it was cut off.  For those of us from European or Western backgrounds, there’s a haunting feeling once you start asking certain questions  Why do I feel like something essential is missing?  Why does modern life feel so hollow, despite comfort?  Why do some cultures seem to carry a memory I don’t have access to?  Over time, I’ve come to see that it’s not about guilt, but grief.  The grief of broken initiation. The grief of severed roots. The grief of having traded connection for control.  Meanwhile, many Black, Indigenous, and Earthbased cultures have somehow preserved parts of the wisdom we were all meant to receive A way of relating to land, to ancestors, to community, to spirit — that doesn’t fracture the self.  Not perfectly. Not without pain. But it survived.  And maybe now, those of us who forgot are being invited to listen again.  Not to appropriate. Not to imitate. But to remember that we too come from something ancient and wise — and that disconnection was never our natural state.  If you’ve felt this before — a subtle, sacred homesickness — you’re not alone. And maybe the healing of this world begins when we stop pretending we were meant to forget.  Im here for this conversation if it resonates with you. Let’s walk it together.   hashtag #AncestralWisdom  hashtag #CulturalMemory  hashtag #Healing  hashtag #Decolonize  hashtag #BlackHistory  hashtag #Remembering  hashtag #LinkedInReflections</h1>
