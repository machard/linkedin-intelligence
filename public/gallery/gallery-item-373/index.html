  <h1>🌍→🪐 The First Time We Might Not Forget  Every few thousand years, a team leaves Earth.  Most of the time, Earth collapses shortly after. Mars inherits the dream — briefly — before silence returns. The records are lost. The languages die. We start over, unaware it’s not the first time.  But this time is different.  This time, we’re anchored to Ethereum.  A shared memory that no one controls. A global clock that ticks across planets. A peertopeer web of value, identity, and truth that resists forgetting.  In a multiplanet future, it won’t be governments or corporations that keep us in sync — it’ll be protocols. Not hierarchies, but networks. Not broadcast towers, but direct links between sovereign nodes.  When we multiply our data channels and connect directly — Earth to Mars, peer to peer — latency fades, and civilization becomes resilient. Not because we finally built better rockets, but because we stopped building fragile systems of trust.  This isn’t science fiction.  It’s just good architecture.  Let’s make sure this is the first exit where humanity doesn’t leave itself behind.   hashtag #Ethereum  hashtag #Web3  hashtag #Interplanetary  hashtag #P2P  hashtag #Decentralization  hashtag #CivilizationDesign  hashtag #FutureIsNow</h1>
