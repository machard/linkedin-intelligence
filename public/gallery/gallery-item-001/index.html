  <h1>🤡🪙 BBC — Big Bitcoin Clown — used to think he was buying freedom.<br /><br />Turns out, what he really bought was a primitive cult membership — paid for with his dignity and values.<br /><br />👉 He swapped critical thinking for slogans.<br />👉 He swapped community for an echo chamber.<br />👉 He swapped sovereignty for a bag he can’t exit.<br /><br />When belief freezes, it stops serving you — you serve it.<br /><br />BBC didn’t notice. He’s too busy chanting “HODL forever!” to remember who he used to be.<br /><br />🔹 Signal is alive. Cults are dead ends.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#Bitcoin <br />hashtag<br />#BBC <br />hashtag<br />#BigBitcoinClown <br />hashtag<br />#CultLogic <br />hashtag<br />#Satire <br />hashtag<br />#SystemicResonance</h1>
