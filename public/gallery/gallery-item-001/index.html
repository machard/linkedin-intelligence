  <h1>Bitcoin Maximalism: The Spectacle of the Uninformed<br /><br />Bitcoin maximalism often parades itself as wisdom, but in truth, it’s the spectacle of ignorance. By rigidly clinging to a frozen narrative, it confuses immutability for clarity and belief for understanding. Systems—and people—thrive through fluidity, learning, and resonance. To mistake this digital rigidity for ultimate truth is to miss the living pulse of technological evolution.<br /><br />It’s time to move beyond dogma, welcome entropy, and let adaptation, not arrogance, lead the way forward.</h1>
