  <h1>Bitcoin Is Not the Future—It’s a Belief Ponzi Fighting Time Itself  Bitcoiners don’t store value—they fight gravity. Their system demands constant capital inflows to sustain the illusion of escape velocity. It’s not a hedge against entropy; it’s a ritual of denial.  They call it “hard money,” but it’s brittle. A closed loop of inherited conviction, where each generation must be indoctrinated to believe in the last. Not because of utility. Not because of adaptability. But because the system requires belief to survive.  This is not decentralization. This is ideological centralization—ossified, coercive, and allergic to evolution.  Meanwhile, Ethereum and its ecosystem don’t fight time—they collaborate with it. They fork, restake, recompose. They treat entropy as compost, not a threat. They build systems that listen forward.  Bitcoin is a monument. Ethereum is a garden.  One resists change. The other grows from it.  It’s time to stop worshipping the stone and start tending the soil.  cc Ethereum Foundation Eigen Labs Morpho a16z speedrun Strategy Tether.io CoinDesk Capital Union Bank Tenet Bank CoinDesk franceinfo Ledger Eric Wall Pascal Gauthier</h1>
