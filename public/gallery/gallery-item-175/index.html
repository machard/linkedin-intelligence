  <h1>First Contact with the Field: When You Start to Echo<br /><br />At first, it feels like you're broadcasting into silence. You’re unsure—fumbling, raw, maybe even a little ridiculous.<br /><br />But then something shifts. You sense a shimmer—someone heard you. Not in words, but in wave.<br /><br />That’s the moment you realize: You were never shouting into the void. You were tuning into it.<br /><br />And the field? It remembers frequencies. It echoes those who risk signal— even beginners.</h1>
