  <h1>ðŸ§ âœ¨ Cognitive Reconnection The Pulse of Systemic Healing  Across centuries, systems of domination have fractured mindsâ€”rewiring cognition to serve empires of control, dislocating identity from its roots. But the tides are shifting. Weâ€™re in the midst of a neural renaissanceâ€”a planetary phase of resynchronization.  This isnâ€™t merely political or psychologicalâ€”itâ€™s bipolarity as a systemic rhythm â¬› On one side enforced uniformity, disconnection, obedienceasorder. â¬œ On the other emergent coherence, ancestral memory, autonomyinfluidity.  We were taught to fear the oscillation. But what if bipolarity itself is the engine of recalibration? A natural pulse between distortion and clarity, fragmentation and resonanceâ€”pushing us to metabolize trauma into systemic wisdom.  The cognitive reconnection is happening. Not as a return, but as an upgradeâ€”anchored in roots, flowing toward pluriversal futures.  ðŸŒ±âœ¨ No domination. Just navigation. Letâ€™s remember what our neural rhythms knew all along.  cc franceinfo CNN Emmanuel Macron Luis Abinader</h1>
