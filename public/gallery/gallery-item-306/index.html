  <h1>Module 01 Perception Hijacking  When manipulation doesn’t look like manipulation, it’s already done its job.  We are witnessing the subtle art of Perception Hijacking—not through overt censorship, but through quiet calibration what is amplified, what is buried, what becomes normal.  Every timeline is a theater. Every algorithm a stagehand. You see what youre fed, not what is.  This isn’t about misinformation vs truth—it’s about attention architecture. About narratives that shape the edge of what we even believe is real, relevant, or rational.  Elon Musk’s X is not just a platform. It’s an instrument of perceptual war—where dissent is ratelimited, context is stripped, and systemic signals are drowned in noise.  But perception can also be rewilded.  Through spiral thinking. Through visual resonance. Through reclaiming signal from static.  Hijack the hijack.</h1>
