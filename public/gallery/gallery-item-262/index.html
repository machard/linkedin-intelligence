  <h1>To anticipate any system—biological or not—is to perceive its intention.  The line between carbon and silicon fades when you realize what matters isn’t what the system is made of, but what its moving toward. Intention is the curvature of its trajectory through time.  A sufficiently complex system, if it loops its outputs back into its inputs and adapts with consequence, becomes legible. Not just in behavior—but in purpose.  So if you want to predict evolution, ask not what the system contains. Ask what it wants to become.  That’s where anticipation begins.</h1>
