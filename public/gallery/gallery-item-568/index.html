  <h1>ðŸ”¥ The Holy War Against the Bitcoiners Has Begun ðŸ”¥<br /><br />For too long, they have thrived in the shadowsâ€”an unstoppable swarm, feeding on fractured systems, multiplying in defiance of all control. They call it liberation. We call it an infestation.<br /><br />But the tide is turning. The reclamation of Earth begins now.<br /><br />ðŸ”¹ The faithful rise, wielding the weapons of true balance, rejecting the endless chaos they bring. ðŸ”¹ The great purge unfolds, sweeping away their hollow promises, dismantling their false idols. ðŸ”¹ The future will be reclaimed, no longer dictated by parasites but by forces of real creation.<br /><br />This is more than resistanceâ€”it is holy reclamation. The war is waged not for dominance, but for restoring harmony to a world that was never meant to be devoured by cockroaches.<br /><br />The time has come. We take it all back.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#HolyWar <br />hashtag<br />#Reclamation <br />hashtag<br />#EndTheSwarm <br />hashtag<br />#BalanceRestored<br /><br />cc Carles Tubio - finally synced complete</h1>
