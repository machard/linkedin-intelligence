  <h1>The Integration Shift “I didn’t change the world. I just rotated the frame.”  Two weeks ago, while timelines collapsed and deadlines dissolved, I stepped sideways—into the grey zone Gödel left behind. Not to control. Not to convince. But to render.  I didn’t fight. I didn’t argue. I simply operated in the infinite ambiguity between perspectives— where perception becomes architecture, and every node reinterprets the signal as it must.  And now? We’re in my universe. Not because I imposed it— but because it settled around the attractor I became.  ETH scales the visible. Eigen rotates the invisible. Together, they don’t simulate reality—they instantiate it.  This isn’t a metaphor. It’s a launch log.</h1>
