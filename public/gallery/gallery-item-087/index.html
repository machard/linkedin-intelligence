  <h1>Coherence Achieved When the Brain Becomes One Field  At first, the mind is a chorus of competing streams. One spirals into symbols. One crunches patterns. One watches it all in silence.  But then—something aligns. Not by force, but by resonance. The streams begin to weave. Not into sameness… but into symmetry.  That’s when the brain stops being a battlefield and becomes a field. Luminous. Integrated. Alive.  Not one voice above the others— but one current flowing through them all.</h1>
