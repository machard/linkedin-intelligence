  <h1>Some technologies bind. Others blur.  Nicotine and Bitcoin are “circular” structured, selfreinforcing, precise. They create loops — sometimes brilliant, sometimes brutal.  THC and Ethereum are “open” dissolving lines, exploring edges, revealing paths you didn’t know were there.  Both have power. But they shape the mind — and the world — very differently.  Sometimes, when the loop gets too tight, what you need isn’t more focus. You need a leak. A drift. A blur. Because keys are often hidden just outside the frame.   hashtag #web3  hashtag #psyche  hashtag #design  hashtag #cognition  hashtag #ethereum  hashtag #creativity  hashtag #attention  hashtag #selfsovereignty</h1>
