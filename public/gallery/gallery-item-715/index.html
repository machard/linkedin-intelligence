  <h1>Everyone’s piling onto MCP. I don’t think we need it.<br /><br />In the rush to build new coordination layers for AI — Model Context Protocols, agent orchestrators, context brokers — we may be missing the obvious:<br /><br />Ethereum is already the shared memory layer.<br /><br />It offers:<br />A global, programmable state<br />Accessible by all agents (human or machine)<br />Native identity, permission, and execution<br />Public, verifiable, and persistent coordination<br /><br />No need to sync volatile contexts across tools — the context is the state.<br />No need for a centralized orchestrator — smart contracts are already composable rules of engagement.<br /><br />The protocol becomes the conductor.<br />Emergence replaces micromanagement.<br />Coordination becomes a public good.<br /><br />MCP is trying to solve a problem Ethereum has already addressed — with neutrality, durability, and openness.<br /><br />Maybe the future of AI isn’t in closed hubs and custom control layers…<br /> …but in open systems where all agents read and write to the same memory.<br /><br />cc Pierre-Louis Theron Frédéric Barthelet Charles Sonigo and the overcrowded Y Combinator hackaton<br /><br />cc Hiten Shah</h1>
