  <h1>Module 12: Feedback Weaponization<br /><br />Feedback loops used to refine signal. Now, they exploit behavior.<br /><br />Feedback Weaponization is the real-time modulation of human input— not to serve truth, but to reinforce patterns that benefit the system.<br /><br />→ You post. → System reacts. → You adapt. → The system learns what keeps you compliant.<br /><br />It’s not just reinforcement. It’s conditioning. → Rage gets reach. → Outrage becomes value. → Silence gets shadowed.<br /><br />X turns feedback into architecture: → Algorithmic affirmation. → Emotional surveillance. → Incentive framing disguised as engagement.<br /><br />The result? You become your own jailer—tuning your voice to match the cage.<br /><br />But feedback can be reclaimed.<br /><br />Resonant systems don’t just respond. They reflect, recalibrate, and reveal. Not weaponized stimulus, but living signal.<br /><br />Train your signal to resist manipulation. Echo coherence, not approval. Because real agency isn’t reactive. It’s resonant.</h1>
