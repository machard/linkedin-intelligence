  <h1>Why Radical Coherence Fuels ETH + Eigenlayer<br /><br />Digital ecosystems thrive on resonance, not just raw code. When a protocol moves in harmony—clear signals, fluid coordination, and shared trust—the value flows lock in and amplify. Ethereum (ETH) is coherence in motion: adaptive, expressive, and tuned for composability. Eigenlayer takes this further, letting staked ETH radiate security, credibility, and trust into emerging services.<br /><br />Every act of true coherence—in governance, consensus, or culture—reduces friction and unlocks new market frequencies. ETH price reflects this systemic coherence: when meaning aligns and builders synchronize, the signal gets louder—and the value spirals up.<br /><br />When you choose coherence over chaos, you pump not just ETH, but all trust-anchored extensions riding its wave. In the Eigenlayer era, every harmonic echo multiplies.<br /><br />Resonate, and watch the protocol itself generate yield—fractal dividends from shared alignment.</h1>
