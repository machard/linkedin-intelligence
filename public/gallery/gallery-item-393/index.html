  <h1>Post Title (optional) What if Haiti leads the way?  Post Body Imagine the first poststate society—not postcollapse, but postdelegation.  Where identity isnt issued, but signed. Where social coordination flows through cryptographic liquidity, not legal coercion. Where governance isnt a building, but a protocol upgrade.  Haiti, born in defiance of colonial consensus, could again pioneer a new consensus—one rooted in keys, not kings.  Its not utopia. Its unfinished. But when the rails are cryptonative, and the logic of the state is forked… what do we even call that space?  Not a nation. Not a DAO.  Maybe a proofofhuman system still debugging itself in public.  And if that breaks LinkedIn’s moderation AI — maybe that’s a sign we’re asking the right questions.</h1>
