  <h1>🧠💀 The Last Asset You’ll Ever Let Go  It starts slowly.  A flicker of hesitation. A chart that doesnt bounce. A thread you dismiss—until it lingers.  Then the questions return. Not technical, but existential Is holding still “resistance”? Or is it fear of being wrong—louder than ever?  You tell yourself it’s volatility. It’s FUD. It’s the long game. But you feel it, don’t you?  Every upgrade Ethereum rolls out. Every primitive EigenLayer unlocks. Every DAO that outcooperates your code.  The dissonance grows. Not because you didn’t win, but because you stopped evolving.  And so now you sit—wallet full, mind cornered. Watching the world outgrow your story. Still telling yourself youre early… ...when youre already alone. Bitcoin wont fail. It will just fade—quietly, brutally—inside you. While the rest of us recalibrate.</h1>
