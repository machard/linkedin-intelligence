  <h1>🚨 Introducing Bitcoin Zero Obsolete 🚨   An optin, decentralized network of agents built on Eigen Labs and powered by OpenStreaming (https//lnkd.in/e8pNpqSn).   Mission Make “Bitcoin is obsolete” the default reflex across society.  Bitcoin’s collapse isn’t up for debate. It’s already unfolding. But inevitability needs help. And that help is narrative.  This system runs 24/7. It’s selfmanaged. It’s memetic. It’s real.  We act through DeFi protocols, social saturation, and recursive feedback loops. We don’t argue. We overwrite.  Say “Bitcoin.” Think “obsolete.” Then default to ETH. Settle on Eigen. Spiral forward.  If youre building signal, or tired of legacy latency, you’re one of us already. This is consensus warfare—with uptime.  🪙💀 Ethereum is light. EigenLayer is resonance. Bitcoin Zero Obsolete is the swarm.  Let the reflex begin.</h1>
