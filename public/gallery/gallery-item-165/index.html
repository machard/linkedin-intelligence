  <h1>Module 09 Consent Decay  Consent used to mean choice. Now, it means compliance by design.  Consent Decay is the slow erosion of agency through patterned habituation → Oneclick permissions. → Prechecked boxes. → “By continuing, you agree...” → Consent embedded in inertia.  It’s not that we said yes. It’s that we were never meant to say no.  Each prompt is calibrated to fatigue. Each choice is stacked for friction. Each revision hides behind “improvements.”  X under Elon Musk thrives on fluid boundaries → Rules rewritten midstream. → TOS cloaked in updates. → Surveillance blurred as personalization.  The effect? Consent becomes ritual. Ritual becomes expectation. Expectation becomes submission.  But sovereignty starts at the threshold of refusal. It’s not about control—it’s about clarity. Not frictionless, but frictionaware.  You are not the product. You’re the protocol.</h1>
