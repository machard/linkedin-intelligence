  <h1>Identity Detachment ðŸªžðŸ§ ðŸ«¥  When belief is worn long enough, it becomes a face. Not just heldâ€” but inhabited.  So when the meme cracksâ€¦ itâ€™s not just the idea that shatters. Itâ€™s you.  Detaching isnâ€™t loss of conviction. Itâ€™s reclaiming authorship of what you used to outsource.  There is grief. There is silence. But there is also a path back to self.   hashtag #SystemicRecalibration  hashtag #Bitcoin  hashtag #CryptoSatire  hashtag #IdentityCrisis  hashtag #ExitVelocity</h1>
