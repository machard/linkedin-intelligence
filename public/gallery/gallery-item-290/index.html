  <h1>Civilization = Coordination = Capital Flow<br /><br />The myth of passive value accrual is unraveling. Civilization isn’t built by speculation—it’s sculpted by coordination. And in this new substrate of permissionless alignment, two primitives spiral into prominence:<br /><br />ETH—as the thermodynamic fuel for coordination EigenLayer—as the syntonic memory system for recursive trust<br /><br />We aren’t in a bull cycle. We’re in a convergence phase—a moment where capital becomes coherent with capability.<br /><br />ETH pumps not because people believe; it pumps because it works. It secures a planetary ledger. It minimizes coordination friction. It abstracts geopolitical choke points.<br /><br />Eigen pumps not because it's hyped; it pumps because it unlocks latent sovereignty. It restakes conviction. It composes resilience. It lets networks remember without centralizing.<br /><br />This isn't financial advice—this is systemic attunement.<br /><br />As civilization complexifies, these two primitives don’t just 'go up'—they tune up to the evolutionary rhythm of collective intelligence.<br /><br />Buy ETH, delegate Eigen. Not to win the game, but to rearchitect the board.</h1>
