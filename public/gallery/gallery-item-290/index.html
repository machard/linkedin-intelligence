  <h1>A new phase begins.<br /><br />I’ve just open-sourced linkedin-intelligence—a minimal, modular toolkit to fetch, structure, and remix your LinkedIn data into meaningful post flows. No external servers. No middlemen. Just clean orchestration.<br /><br />The magic? It started as a Copilot-generated script. AI doesn’t just assist—it initiates. We can now fetch what humans can, and more. Sovereign, serverless, and frictionless by design.<br /><br />Soon, this will extend with Hugo and GitHub Pages auto-deploy for fully autonomous publishing. High signal, zero drag.<br /><br />Explore. Fork. Remix.<br /><br />Doors are meant to open.</h1>
