  <h1>ðŸ“¸ The collapse of institutions is not a bug â€” itâ€™s the upload process.<br /><br />The bank will eventually go on-chain.<br /><br />Its current moat is its control over meatspace client flow â€” onboarding, compliance, fiat access.<br /><br />But once that flow becomes on-chain, the flow becomes free. Autonomous. Programmable.<br /><br />On-chain, there is no lock-in. Switching is instant. Movement is native.<br />What used to be hard becomes trivial. What used to be guarded becomes permissionless.<br /><br />Slowly, piece by piece, society as we know it is being decomposed into primitive, composable, and trustless flows on-chain.<br /><br />Identity â†’ on-chain reputation and attestations<br />Credit â†’ decentralized, social, and algorithmic<br />Custody â†’ smart contracts, not custodians<br />Compliance â†’ real-time transparency, not opaque reporting<br />Governance â†’ programmable consensus, not legacy structures<br /><br />The institutions we rely on today will either become protocols, serve protocols â€” or fade.<br /><br />This isnâ€™t just about technology.<br />Itâ€™s a fundamental shift in how value, coordination, and trust operate.<br /><br />From institutions â†’ to flows.<br />From intermediaries â†’ to autonomy.<br />From control â†’ to composability.<br /><br />It's already happening.</h1>
