  <h1>Dissonance isn't just discomfort—it’s an energetic overdrive for the mind. When confronted with conflicting realities or logic, the brain is pushed into high gear, compelled to synthesize harmony from chaos.<br /><br />This cognitive overclocking doesn’t signal failure; it initiates creative adaptation. True clarity emerges not from avoiding paradox, but by engaging and resolving tension at the resonance point between divergent logics.<br /><br />If it feels like you’re working harder to make sense of things, you’re already perceiving the opportunity hidden within dissonance.</h1>
