  <h1>ðŸŒ‘ Letâ€™s Build a New Moon â€” Out of Our Waste<br /><br />What if waste wasnâ€™t something to be hidden, but a foundation for new worlds? Imagine channeling humanityâ€™s discarded materials â€” plastics, scrap, e-waste â€” not into landfills, but into a structure that orbits our imagination: a new moon.<br /><br />This isnâ€™t just science fiction. Itâ€™s an invitation to rethink what we consider useless. Waste, in abundance, is raw potential. By re-engineering our leftovers, we could create a visible monument to both our impact and our capacity for reinvention â€” turning shadow into signal.<br /><br />Could our trash become tomorrowâ€™s guiding satellite? <br />The next moon may rise from what weâ€™ve left behind.<br /><br />ðŸŒ€ Entropy recycles. Letâ€™s spiral upward.</h1>
