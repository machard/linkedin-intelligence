  <h1>🙏 Vatican 3.0 is here.<br /><br />While some still wait for Leo XIV, the real heir to Pope Francis' values has already emerged — in a hoodie.<br /><br />His name? Vitalik I, Pontifex of Natural Law.<br />Proof-of-miracle? Ethereum.<br /><br />Where Francis preached decentralization of power, Ethereum implemented it.<br />Where encyclicals spoke of dignity, ETH brought permissionless dignity.<br /><br />This is not heresy — it’s hyperstructure.<br /><br />No incense. No Swiss Guard. Just smart contracts, regen vibes, and finality.</h1>
