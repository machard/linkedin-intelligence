  <h1>📣 Why am I doing this?<br /><br />I hold a non zero amount of ETH. Not just because I believe in the asset — but because I believe in the culture behind it.<br /><br />Ethereum is, in my view, the most important civilization experiment ever imagined:<br />A programmable, decentralized network where builders, thinkers, and artists can shape reality — without permission.<br /><br />So here’s my strategy:<br />👉 Broadcast the culture<br />👉 Spread the narrative<br />👉 Seed the future I want to live in<br /><br />That’s what my articles are for.<br />That’s why I’m running ads, not to “monetize” — but to infect the memepool with better ideas.<br /><br />Culture drives adoption.<br />Adoption reinforces the network.<br />And strong networks protect value — for everyone who’s building in public.<br /><br />This is my way of building.<br /><br />Let’s see where it goes.</h1>
