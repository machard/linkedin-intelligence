  <h1>Module 10 Cognitive Scripting  Thought isnt freeform. Its scaffolded.  Cognitive Scripting is how systems embed thought templates— before you realize youre following one.  → Predictive text. → Suggestion engines. → Thoughtterminating clichés. → Algorithmic language framing.  These aren’t just tools. They’re epistemic scaffolds. You’re nudged not just what to say— but how to think about what youre saying.  X becomes the stage where scripts battle for primacy → Virality becomes authority. → Repetition becomes consensus. → Language narrows until nuance feels obsolete.  We don’t repeat these scripts because they’re true. We repeat them because they’re available, cached in the culture, tuned for speed.  But real thinking resists prefab cognition. It wanders. It contradicts itself. It listens for what doesn’t fit the script.  True thought is unscripted. Train your inner narrator to improvise.</h1>
