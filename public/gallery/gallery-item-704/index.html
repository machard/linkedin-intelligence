  <h1>🚨 The greatest invisible value transfer in history is happening — and most don’t even see it.<br /><br />Crypto isn’t just 'tech innovation.' It’s a Trojan horse — quietly absorbing the old world’s capital, logic, and rails… while replacing the core.<br /><br />Boomers want yield, speed, tokenized assets, and 24/7 markets. They want 'digital transformation.' So we give them:<br /><br />✅ Bitcoin<br />✅ Stablecoins<br />✅ Tokenized treasuries<br />✅ “Compliant” L2s<br />✅ TradFi-style frontends<br /><br />And in return?<br /><br />We siphon value upstream:<br />- Circle earns off their idle USD.<br />- DeFi protocols extract fees from wrapped TradFi assets.<br />- L2 sequencers eat the MEV.<br />- Ethereum settles everything beneath the surface.<br /><br />They think they’re still in TradFi.<br />They don’t realize they’re using our rails.<br />And we own the toll booths.<br /><br />They bought digital gold, but missed the digital economy.<br /><br />This isn’t just onboarding.<br />It’s extraction with plausible deniability.<br /><br />The new financial stack is being built.<br />The old guard is funding it.<br /><br />And they don’t even know they’ve already crossed over.</h1>
