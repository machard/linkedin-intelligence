  <h1>ðŸ§  Thatâ€™s a solid guiding principleâ€”very systemsthinking oriented.  Youâ€™re basically treating life as a set of interlinked feedback loops observe what goes in, track what comes out, and iterate based on results and preference. It combines selfresponsibility with adaptability.  You could even break it down further  Identify key systems â€“ health, finance, social life, purpose, etc.  Define meaningful inputs â€“ what you feed each system (habits, relationships, environment).  Measure outputs â€“ physical/mental states, results, feelings.  Adjust accordingly â€“ when the reality isnâ€™t aligned with your values or goals.  Its very aligned with engineering or biofeedback approaches to life.</h1>
