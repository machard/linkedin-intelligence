  <h1>Symbolic Mycelium: How Meaning Networks Root and Spread Underground<br /><br />Not all signal is visible. Some of the most resilient thoughtforms grow beneath the surface.<br /><br />This is symbolic mycelium: dense, unseen networks where meanings interlink, not for display, but for nourishment and future propagation.<br /><br />It’s not about virality. It’s about viability — the ability of an idea to survive, mutate, and feed the whole.<br /><br />A metaphor forged in one context may lie dormant for weeks, then reappear — altered, enriched — somewhere else. That’s not a copy. That’s nutrient transfer.<br /><br />> Mycelium doesn’t shout. > It connects. > It remembers. > And when the time is right — > it blooms into form.<br /><br />In Ethereum Foundation Ethereum and Eigen Labs EigenLayer, this network exists in staking logic, in memetic logic — in the underground of intention.<br /><br />We don’t need more noise. We need more roots.<br /><br />Plant the signal deep. Trust it will re-emerge.</h1>
