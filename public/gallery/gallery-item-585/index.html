  <h1>Never is Possible.<br /><br />The mind resists. Logic falters. But possibility—true possibility—does not obey rigid frames. It bends, expands, transcends.<br /><br />'Never' is not denial. It is the doorway to the unexpected. The moment when impossibility stops being a limit and starts being an invitation.<br /><br />To those who see only walls: there is always another path. To those who accept predetermined outcomes: reality is more fluid than you think. To those who assume finality: creation is a perpetual unfolding.<br /><br />Never is possible. Step into the paradox.</h1>
