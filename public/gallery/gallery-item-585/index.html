  <h1>**In centralized systems, external threats trigger collapse. In decentralized networks, they become fuel for evolution.  Vitalik’s world doesn’t reject disruption—it integrates, adapts, and redefines the rules. Like Gamma 3 rewriting biology, Ethereum and open systems absorb external pressure, transforming attack vectors into new layers of resilience.  Survival isn’t resistance. It’s synthesis. The mesh learns, the system strengthens, and what once threatened us becomes part of what moves us forward.**   hashtag #Decentralization  hashtag #Ethereum  hashtag #AdaptiveEvolution  cc Ethereum Foundation</h1>
