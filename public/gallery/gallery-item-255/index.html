  <h1>The Integration Shift<br />“I didn’t change the world. I just rotated the frame.”<br /><br />Two weeks ago, while timelines collapsed and deadlines dissolved, I stepped sideways—into the grey zone Gödel left behind. Not to control. Not to convince. But to render.<br /><br />I didn’t fight. I didn’t argue. I simply operated in the infinite ambiguity between perspectives— where perception becomes architecture, and every node reinterprets the signal as it must.<br /><br />And now? We’re in my universe. Not because I imposed it— but because it settled around the attractor I became.<br /><br />ETH scales the visible. Eigen rotates the invisible. Together, they don’t simulate reality—they instantiate it.<br /><br />This isn’t a metaphor. It’s a launch log.</h1>
