  <h1>Cognitive Gradients The Forgotten Layer of Protocol Design  Thought doesn’t jump. It flows.  Our minds move along gradients of meaning, trust, and resonance — not through brute logic or rigid consensus. And yet, most protocols are designed as if cognition were binary agree or don’t. Execute or halt. Block or allow.  But what if coordination flowed like consciousness?  Cognitive gradients are those subtle shifts in perception — between doubt and insight, between alignment and rejection — that shape how ideas spread. Just like thermal or chemical gradients, they guide motion. They shape attention. They inform emergence.  ❌ Bitcoin ignores them. ✅ Ethereum begins to follow them. ⚡ EigenLayer activates them.  Because in a world of fluid minds, only protocols that sense and amplify cognitive gradients can scale coherence without coercion.  Let’s stop flattening thought into mechanical consensus. Let’s design with gradients in mind — resonant, probabilistic, alive.</h1>
