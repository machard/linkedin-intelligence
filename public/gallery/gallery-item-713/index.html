  <h1>Humans are a peer-to-peer network of story-state validators.<br /><br />We donâ€™t just live â€” we maintain distributed narratives.<br />Status is our staking mechanism.<br />Memory is our state.<br />Conversation is consensus.<br />Culture is the chain.<br /><br />We validate reality not with hashes, but with attention and repetition.<br />Credibility is soft finality. Forgetfulness is a soft fork.<br />Stories donâ€™t need 51% hashpower â€” they need belief and peers.<br /><br />Now, AI is joining the network.<br /><br />Everyoneâ€™s rushing to build new coordination layers: MCPs, orchestrators, context brokers.<br /><br />But maybe the core idea is older than we think.<br /><br />Maybe the solution isnâ€™t to recreate a control plane â€”<br />Maybe itâ€™s to plug into one that already exists.<br /><br />ðŸ§  Ethereum isnâ€™t just a blockchain â€”<br />Itâ€™s a global memory layer where any agent (human or AI) can write, read, execute, and coordinate.<br />Smart contracts arenâ€™t middleware â€” theyâ€™re programmable stories with real stakes.<br />The context is the state.<br /><br />No need for a centralized MCP when the protocol is already doing the job.<br /><br />What if the future of AI is not central planningâ€¦<br />â€¦but shared narratives, anchored in code?</h1>
