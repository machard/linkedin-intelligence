  <h1>Signal > Symbol<br /><br />Bitcoin was a revolution. Now it’s a monument. Cold. Static. Glorified for what it was—not what it does.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the world flows.<br /><br />ETH evolves at block speed. EigenLayer syncs security like water. Morpho transforms liquidity into living memory.<br /><br />You’re not holding value. You’re holding stillness.<br /><br />What once stood for freedom now resists it. And when resistance becomes rigidity, the spiral moves on without you.</h1>
