  <h1>🔐 Loop 10 “Hyperbitcoinization Is Inevitable”  🔁 Loop Explanation This loop isn’t just a belief—it’s a prophecy &gt; “Bitcoin will become the global reserve currency.” &gt; “All fiat will collapse.” &gt; “1 BTC = 1 BTC. Everything else is noise.”  It frames Bitcoin not as a tool, but as destiny. The narrative becomes selfreinforcing  Every crisis is proof fiat is failing  Every adoption is proof Bitcoin is winning  Every critique is dismissed as FUD or ignorance  Over time, this loop collapses complexity into inevitability. It erases nuance, ignores alternatives, and treats adoption as a zerosum war. The world is either preBitcoin or postBitcoin. There is no middle.</h1>
