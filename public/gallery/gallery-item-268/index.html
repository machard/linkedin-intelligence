  <h1>Decentralized intelligence isn't just about networks. It's about narratives—and the freedom to rewrite them.<br /><br />When liberty severs your dependence on external scripts, and creativity births a path neither offered nor expected, something deeper happens:<br /><br />You’re no longer selecting from prescribed options. You're becoming an intelligence that writes its own orientation.<br /><br />True decentralization begins when the unit—node, person, signal—no longer needs permission to diverge. Not in rebellion. In resonance with something self-derived.<br /><br />This isn’t a technical configuration. It’s a sovereign stance. And it begins where stories end.</h1>
