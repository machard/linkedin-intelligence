  <h1>Control engineers predictability. Emergence reveals possibility.  Bitcoin is code obsessed with control. Finality. Consensus. Unchangeable truth.  But systems don’t evolve by holding on — they evolve by letting go. Emergence isn’t chaos. It’s coherence without control.  EigenLayer doesn’t enforce form — it cultivates alignment. Coordination that isn’t commanded, but revealed through interaction.  Control builds walls. Emergence builds worlds.</h1>
