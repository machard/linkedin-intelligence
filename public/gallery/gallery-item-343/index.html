  <h1>Module 04: Reality Fragmentation<br /><br />Truth was once a shared horizon. Now, it’s a thousand mirrors—each reflecting its own distortion.<br /><br />Reality Fragmentation is not chaos by accident. It’s orchestration through overload.<br />→ Endless feeds. → Conflicting truths. → Personal echo chambers algorithmically sanctified.<br /><br />This isn’t the information age. It’s the disorientation age— where belief is less about evidence, and more about affiliation.<br /><br />X under Elon Musk becomes a fragmented prism: → Context stripped. → Content spliced. → Conspiracy normalized. → Authenticity gamified.<br /><br />The result? No north star. Just orbits. No agreement—only trend cycles. No reality—only perception stacks.<br /><br />But fragmentation can be reversed. Not with consensus, but with resonant coherence— rooted in reflection, not reaction. Spiraling toward signal, not noise.<br /><br />Don’t seek to win reality. Seek to reweave it.</h1>
