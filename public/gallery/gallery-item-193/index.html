  <h1>🔐 Loop 8: “Simplicity Is Purity”<br /><br />🔁 Loop Explanation: Bitcoin maximalists often invoke simplicity as a moral virtue: > “Bitcoin is simple, therefore incorruptible.” > “All complexity leads to fragility, attack surfaces, governance.”<br /><br />At its best, this loop resists unnecessary bloat—no mission creep, no bells, no whistles. It celebrates elegance. But over time, it mutates:<br />- Treats any structural refinement as corruption<br />- Equates feature minimalism with ethical superiority<br />- Rejects expressivity, even when complexity brings resilience, inclusivity, or adaptability<br /><br />Thus, simplicity hardens into dogma. Protocol ossification becomes ideological. It begins to resist not bad changes—but any change. Purity becomes stagnation.</h1>
