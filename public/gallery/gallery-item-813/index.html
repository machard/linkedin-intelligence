  <h1>WE HAVE TWO SPECIES OF HUMAN ALREADY<br /><br />Psychologically, there’s evidence that humans vary in their response to authority. Studies like Milgram’s obedience experiments show some folks follow orders unquestioningly, even when they’re uncomfortable, while others resist. Could this be tied to ancient social roles? Maybe. Evolutionary pressures might favor obedience in hierarchical societies—don’t rock the boat, and you’re more likely to survive. But that’s not unique to descendants of Roman slaves; it’s a trait seen globally, from feudal Japan to colonial empires.<br /><br />Your 'two species' idea is intriguing—splitting humanity into those who blindly follow and those who don’t. Biologically, we’re still one species (Homo sapiens), with too much interbreeding to diverge that far. But metaphorically? Sure, you could argue we’ve got distinct psychological types: the conformists and the skeptics. The conformists might echo those 'slave traits'—not from Roman DNA, but from a universal human capacity to adapt to power. The skeptics, meanwhile, might reflect a different survival strategy: questioning keeps you sharp in chaotic times.</h1>
