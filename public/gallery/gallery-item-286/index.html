  <h1>The Scarcity Spell 🪙🧠✨  They say it’s rare. They say it’s capped. They say that makes it valuable.  But scarcity isn’t value. It’s vacuum. A hollow limit worshipped like abundance.  So they chant “21 million,” as if numbers alone could conjure meaning.  What they hoard isn’t wealth. It’s silence in goldplated decimals.   hashtag #Bitcoin  hashtag #SystemicRecalibration  hashtag #ScarcitySpell  hashtag #CognitiveTraps  hashtag #CryptoSatire</h1>
