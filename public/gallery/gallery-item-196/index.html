  <h1>🔐 Loop 6: “Incentives Solve Everything”<br /><br />🔁 Loop Explanation: This loop emerges from economics, metastasizes in cryptoland, and calcifies into doctrine. At its core is a powerful truth:<br /><br />> If you design the right incentives, good behavior emerges.<br /><br />It becomes the rallying cry of mechanism design, tokenomics, game theory. But here’s where the loop closes:<br />- Every failure is reframed as an incentive misalignment<br />- Every solution becomes a market tweak<br />- Every social layer—trust, culture, context—is dismissed as noise<br /><br />Over time, humans become utility maximizers, not meaning-makers. Signals become prices, not expressions. Systems become self-justifying machines, not spaces of value negotiation.<br /><br />Protocols cease to coordinate people. They coordinate tokens that simulate people.</h1>
