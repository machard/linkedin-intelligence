  <h1>🔐 Loop 9: “Hard Money Ends All Corruption”<br /><br />🔁 Loop Explanation: This loop begins with a kernel of truth: inflationary regimes often enable rent-seeking, wealth erosion, and opaque redistribution. Bitcoiners respond with:<br /><br />> “Sound money fixes this.” > “If money can’t be printed, corruption can’t thrive.” > “Hard money = incorruptible system.”<br /><br />But over time, this morphs into a moral absolutism:<br />- All corruption is blamed on fiat<br />- All virtue is projected onto scarcity<br />- Structural inequality, power asymmetries, and governance failures are ignored<br /><br />The result? A belief that monetary hardness is a panacea—that once Bitcoin wins, justice will follow. But corruption is not just monetary—it’s relational, institutional, and systemic.</h1>
