  <h1>ðŸªžðŸ“‰ Opening Soon: Bitcoin Market Place of Shame<br /><br />Not an art gallery. A reckoning.<br /><br />Each NFT: a mirror. A scar. A crystallized contradiction. Proof-of-Cognitive-Dissonance etched on-chain.<br /><br />From the Whale Who Couldn't Exit to the Halving High Priest in Denial. From Frozen Maximalist to Liquidity Mirage.<br /><br />You once believed. Now you just refresh price charts and call it research.<br /><br />Come stare into the tokenized relics of a worldview that calcified too soon. Every piece is for sale. None can be bought with conviction.<br /><br />BTC wonâ€™t die. It will haunt. Right here, on-chain.</h1>
