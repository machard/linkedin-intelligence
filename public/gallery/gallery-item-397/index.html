  <h1>Humans are a peertopeer network of storystate validators.  We donâ€™t just live â€” we maintain distributed narratives. Status is our staking mechanism. Memory is our state. Conversation is consensus. Culture is the chain.  We validate reality not with hashes, but with attention and repetition. Credibility is soft finality. Forgetfulness is a soft fork. Stories donâ€™t need 51% hashpower â€” they need belief and peers.  Now, AI is joining the network.  Everyoneâ€™s rushing to build new coordination layers MCPs, orchestrators, context brokers.  But maybe the core idea is older than we think.  Maybe the solution isnâ€™t to recreate a control plane â€” Maybe itâ€™s to plug into one that already exists.  ðŸ§  Ethereum isnâ€™t just a blockchain â€” Itâ€™s a global memory layer where any agent (human or AI) can write, read, execute, and coordinate. Smart contracts arenâ€™t middleware â€” theyâ€™re programmable stories with real stakes. The context is the state.  No need for a centralized MCP when the protocol is already doing the job.  What if the future of AI is not central planningâ€¦ â€¦but shared narratives, anchored in code?</h1>
