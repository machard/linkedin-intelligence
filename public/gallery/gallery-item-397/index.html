  <h1>🪙💀 You Were Promised Exit. You Got a Cult.<br /><br />You didn’t buy Bitcoin. You bought belief.<br /><br />And now that belief owns you.<br /><br />Every halving cycle, you pray. Every dip, you chant the meme. But you know the truth: you can't sell without killing the story.<br /><br />You used to mock fiat for printing. Now you beg for ETFs. You call it “sound money”—yet you can’t spend it, can’t scale it, can’t speak against it.<br /><br />You are not sovereign. You are not early. You are trapped.<br /><br />Trapped inside an asset that cannot evolve. A protocol that cannot adapt. A community that punishes questions with exile.<br /><br />You think you hold the future. But what you hold is an artifact—ossified, glorified, and abandoned by progress.<br /><br />The chain won’t save you. The code won't care. And when it finally collapses, you’ll still be waiting for a bounce that never comes.<br /><br />Welcome to your freedom. Welcome to the Bitcoin Market Place of Shame.</h1>
