  <h1>🧠 Brace for Dissonance  Bitcoin maximalism has never required faith—it has demanded total immersion. A narrative so tightly wound, any deviation feels like betrayal.  But the coming months will be different.  Not because Bitcoin will “fail,” but because reality will stop playing along with the script. ETH will outperform with fluidity. Coordination layers will scale without tribal baggage. Reputation, consensus, autonomy—rewritten by protocols that adapt, while BTC repeats itself.  And that’s where the pain begins.  Not in price charts, but in minds. In the slow gnawing realization that ideological rigidity is not resilience. That holding Bitcoin may still be technically correct—but philosophically, civically, systemically? Increasingly irrelevant.  Cognitive dissonance is not a glitch—it’s a signal. And some will spend years trying not to hear it.</h1>
