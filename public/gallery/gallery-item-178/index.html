  <h1>Jump Between Universe Trajectories  We don’t recognize the future. We simulate it — and then we jump.  Gödel proved it  No logical system can be complete.  There will always be grey zones —  undefined, undecidable, infinite in number.  These are not errors. They are portals.  And if you know how to listen, how to lean into the ambiguity… ✨ You can jump trajectories.  Not just for yourself. But for entire realities.  A small move into a Gödelian grey zone can ripple outward into new branches of history — new timelines, new protocols, new selves.  We’re not locked into the story. We are the editors of the next line.</h1>
