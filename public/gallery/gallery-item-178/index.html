  <h1>Module 07 Trust Collapse  Trust is the invisible scaffolding of every system. Once it cracks, collapse isn’t loud—it’s cascading.  Trust Collapse begins slowly, then all at once → Factcheckers become suspect. → Experts lose legitimacy. → Platforms eat their own credibility. → Signals blur, and doubt becomes default.  This isn’t just about lies. It’s about institutional entropy—where each contradiction, each shadow ban, each silent tweak erodes the architecture of belief.  X under Elon Musk accelerates this collapse. Transparency is performative.  Rules are unstable. Moderation is unpredictable. Users become test subjects in realtime.  When trust evaporates, two responses emerge  Retreat into tribal enclaves.  Seek coherence beyond the noise.  But real coherence isn’t imposed—it’s emergent. It comes from aligned intent, visible protocol, and mutual accountability. Not force. Not persuasion. Not virality.  Collapse isn’t the end—it’s a clearing. What we reweave next decides everything.</h1>
