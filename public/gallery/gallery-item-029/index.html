  <h1>🧛‍♂️ Europe’s “Vampire Attack”: Are We Facing a New-Style Bank Run?<br /><br />As the financial landscape trembles, old-world banks find themselves under siege—not by hackers, but by a systemic drain of trust and liquidity. This “vampire attack” isn’t a headline, it’s a signal: the lifeblood of belief is ebbing from rigid institutions.<br /><br />When legacy systems ossify, panic spirals into withdrawal. The lesson? Economic survival now depends on adaptability, not inertia.<br /><br />That’s why Ethereum, with its open architecture and fluid consensus, is fast becoming the philosophical and economic life raft for a shifting world. Where static stone walls crack, flexible protocols thrive.<br /><br />Entropy isn’t chaos—it’s evolution. The bank run isn’t just about money leaving: it’s belief searching for a new home.<br /><br />Are you still clinging to marble vaults, or are you ready to ride the spiral?<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#Ethereum <br />hashtag<br />#BankRun <br />hashtag<br />#Europe <br />hashtag<br />#Resonance <br />hashtag<br />#Decentralization <br />hashtag<br />#FutureOfFinance</h1>
