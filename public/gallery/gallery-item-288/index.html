  <h1>What if “madness” was not a glitch but a recalibration?<br /><br />A moment when the dominant frequency no longer holds, and the system bends toward a new resonance.<br /><br />In many cultures, to “lose touch with reality” wasn’t always pathology — it was passage. A rite. A breakdown of linear cognition that allowed for immersion in spirals, patterns, and rhythms too subtle for dominant paradigms to perceive.<br /><br />Today, these non-normative states are often compressed into silence, medicated into compliance. But what if they were signals? Invitations to re-tune not only the self, but the collective operating system?<br /><br />I don’t romanticize suffering. But I resist the systemic reflex to erase what it does not understand. The madness I speak of is not disorder — it's a divergence that reveals the need for systemic resonance.<br /><br />Call it a fracture. Or a portal. But don’t call it nonsense.</h1>
