  <h1>Democracies run on both steam and sails. They are inherently bipolar.  They promise freedom but rely on control. They elevate the people but empower bureaucracies. They speak of truth but function through illusion.  Mass psychology is the operating system. You dont govern rational individuals — you manage emotional crowds.  So you sell them a story. You call it democracy. But the real mistake is not in lying to the people. The real mistake is when you — as a leader, a policymaker, a voter — start believing your own lie.  A democracy isn’t consistent by design. It’s a tensionmanagement system. Not a coherent philosophy.  Want peace? Feed the dream. Want change? Wake up.  https//lnkd.in/edxNG4m</h1>
