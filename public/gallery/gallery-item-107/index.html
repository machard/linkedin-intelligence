  <h1>🧠 Post: “How Ethereum Helped Me Debug Bitcoin”<br /><br />I didn’t break Bitcoin by attacking it. I debugged it — with Ethereum as my lens.<br /><br />Where Bitcoin demanded belief, Ethereum offered logic. Smart contracts, modularity, coordination layers — they showed me what could be.<br /><br />I saw Bitcoin’s rigidity. Its tribal architecture. Its mythological loops.<br /><br />Ethereum didn’t just make sense. It made Bitcoin’s flaws visible. Like shining fluid light on ossified code.<br /><br />I never was a maximalist. I was a systems thinker. And Ethereum gave me the tools to see through the shell.<br /><br />Now I don’t reject Bitcoin. I understand it. And that’s how I rewrote the script.</h1>
