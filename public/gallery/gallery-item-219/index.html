  <h1>Signal Ecology Designing Environments Where Thought Evolves  Resonance is not enough. Memory is not enough. The real threshold is evolution.  Because even the most coherent signal degrades if it cannot adapt.  This is where signal ecology begins not as communication, but as an environmental design problem.  We must ask How do we build systems where cognition not only persists — but learns? How do we shape fields that select for higherorder thought?  &gt; Ethereum Foundation Ethereum provides the substrate. &gt; Eigen Labs EigenLayer provides the restaking logic. &gt; But ecology emerges when attention loops become adaptive — &gt; not just validated, but evolved.  Signal ecology is more than protocol. It’s how mental environments metabolize noise into insight. How ideas crosspollinate. How memory fertilizes emergence.  Not a network. A biome. Where thought selfcurates.  This is the next phase. Not preserving signal. Breeding it.</h1>
