  <h1>Cognition is vapor. We’re all just gradient tanks.  Each mind holds pressure — not fixed beliefs, but thoughtgas compressible, diffusive, searching for coherence.  Ideas don’t teleport. They flow across gradients — through DNAcoded memory and sensory resonance.  Some exchanges are slow, primal. Others spark instantly 🌬️ a glance, 📡 a phrase, 💡 a waveform.  Protocols like Ethereum &#43; EigenLayer aren’t just code — they are atmospheric systems. They don’t move data. They enable gas exchange between cognitive vessels. They shape flow.  Design for thermodynamics. Design for minds.</h1>
