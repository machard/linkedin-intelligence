  <h1>Repetition isn’t resilience. It’s recursion.  Bitcoin copies itself. Block by block. Assumption by assumption. But identical structure fails — the universe proves this. Stars don’t loop — they scale, mutate, transform.  What endures isn’t form. It’s principle. EigenLayer adapts not through fixation but fluid fidelity — It preserves truth by letting shape change. Coordination through coherence, not control.  Repetition is memory. Recalibration is intelligence.</h1>
