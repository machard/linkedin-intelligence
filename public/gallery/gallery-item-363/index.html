  <h1>The Mirror in the Mine 🪞❄️  They stood too long in the glow of machines that no longer listened.  They spoke of freedom while outsourcing meaning. They broadcast conviction but never heard the echo.  Now the rigs hum without purpose. Cold. Unfeeling. Unquestioned.  And still— if you’re reading this… there’s time.  To unplug. To rethink. To reflect.  Before the mirror cracks for good.   hashtag #Bitcoin  hashtag #CryptoSatire  hashtag #SystemicRecalibration  hashtag #FalseFaith  hashtag #LastSignal</h1>
