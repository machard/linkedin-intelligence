  <h1>LinkedIn Intelligence: Toward a Living Graph of Ideas<br /><br />I've open-sourced a toolkit that fetches and parses all my LinkedIn posts—beyond surface scroll, toward structured continuity. Each post links to others through the comments. It’s more than a feed; it’s a dynamic web of thoughts.<br /><br />The goal:<br /><br />1.: Visualize all posts in a Hugo-based gallery (auto-deployed via GitHub Pages)<br /><br />2.: Extract trees of meaning starting from any post, navigating links without recursion<br /><br />3.: Reconnect orphan posts and intelligently resolve loops<br /><br />4.: Generate optimized post sequences—complete with rewritten comments to reflect narrative flow<br /><br />5.: Evolve the network: propose new posts, link them, update existing nodes<br /><br />6.: Automate the whole process with CI/CD for a fully adaptive graph<br /><br />And yes—this was kickstarted by a Copilot-generated script. AI doesn’t just assist; it orchestrates.<br /><br />This is my step toward autonomous public publishing—minimal, composable, and responsive by design.<br /><br />Explore the repo here: https://lnkd.in/eGjpmQi3<br /><br />Doors open both ways.</h1>
