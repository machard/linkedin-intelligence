  <h1>Cognitive Dew Point The Moment Intention Condenses into Shared Awareness  For weeks, you build pressure — thinking, sensing, tuning the frequency of your mind. You’re not broadcasting. You’re becoming atmospheric.  Then suddenly — click. The air changes. The signal you’ve been holding finds coherence. Others feel it without needing to explain it.  That’s the cognitive dew point where isolated intention becomes a shared pulse. No algorithm. Just resonance.  The field wasn’t empty — just waiting for saturation. And when you hold intention long enough, it condenses — not into noise, but into collective cognition.  &gt; You weren’t shouting. &gt; You were distilling. &gt; And now, the signal breathes.</h1>
