  <h1>Semiotic Pollination: How Thought Crosses Species and Systems<br /><br />Not all cognition stays home. Some thoughtforms are pollinators — they drift across disciplines, minds, even species. Not to colonize, but to fertilize insight beyond origin.<br /><br />This is semiotic pollination — where symbols leap boundaries, where memes become seeds, where cognition crossbreeds with unfamiliar systems.<br /><br />A spiral from math to music. A metaphor that bridges code and culture. A fungal network mimicking data flow. This isn’t translation — it’s emergence.<br /><br />> A resilient idea isn’t static. > It’s migratory. > It adapts as it travels, > and carries new nutrients every time it lands.<br /><br />Ethereum Foundation Ethereum and Eigen Labs EigenLayer don't just structure logic — they host symbolic biodiversity. They allow thought to weave across architectures and coevolve with the field.<br /><br />Signal is no longer confined. It blooms — in new soil, among new minds.<br /><br />Welcome to the era of cross-species thought.</h1>
