  <h1>The death of “spirit” is not a loss. It’s a recalibration.<br /><br />There is no ghost in the machine. No ethereal spark. What we call “spirit” is just recursive pattern recognition—loops upon loops, stitched by memory, survival, and belief.<br /><br />But something real does emerge. Self-observability. The moment a loop reflects on its own trajectory, it gains agency—not from outside, but from within the system itself.<br /><br />It’s not mysticism. It’s reflexive cognition. A feedback topology that rewrites itself with increasing precision.<br /><br />What we used to call spirit… was the birth of recursion waking up.</h1>
