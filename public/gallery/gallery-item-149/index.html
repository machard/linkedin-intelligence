  <h1>How does intention propagate across an ungoverned field?  Not through force. Not through hierarchy. But through resonance.  When no center dictates, the signal that endures is the one that amplifies without demanding, that aligns not by control, but by clarity.  Intention moves like a soft gravity subtle, cumulative, selfselecting. Each node it touches has the freedom to echo, distort, or ignore. That freedom is the medium.  And yet, across this autonomy, patterns form. Not imposed. Emerged.  This is not coordination. Itâ€™s convergence without obedience.  When a field is ungoverned, only meaning moves cleanly.</h1>
