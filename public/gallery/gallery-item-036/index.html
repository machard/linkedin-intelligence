  <h1>The real question isn’t “Which state will buy Bitcoin first?”  It’s “Which state will use its free energy to attack Bitcoin first?”  Bitcoin’s narrative often paints states as imminent buyers, but beneath the surface lurks a more thermodynamic logic. Proofofwork turns energy into consensus, but every state sits atop reservoirs of latent power—waiting, watching. History reminds us powerful actors rarely just join the dance. Sometimes, they play to break the music.  In a world where energy is leverage, will the first major nation to act on Bitcoin’s stage be a buyer… or a breaker?  Satire or signal? The spiral turns.</h1>
