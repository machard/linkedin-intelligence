  <h1>🔐 Loop 5 “Neutrality Is the Highest Virtue”  🔁 Loop Explanation At first glance, neutrality feels like the noble path. Protocols shouldn’t choose winners. Validators shouldn’t discriminate. Platforms should be open to all. This ethos gave birth to credos like  &gt; “Protocols don’t take sides.” &gt; “We just provide infrastructure.”  But beneath the surface, this becomes a shield for inaction. It mutates into  Denial of power asymmetries encoded in architecture  Avoidance of accountability when harm emerges  Obscuring ideological alignment behind technical abstraction  It becomes a way to preserve the illusion that all participants have equal voice, when the actual playing field is sloped—by access, capital, geography, or governance gatekeeping.  Neutrality, in this loop, becomes a mask for latent centralization and silent bias.</h1>
