  <h1>🔐 Loop 10: “Hyperbitcoinization Is Inevitable”<br /><br />🔁 Loop Explanation: This loop isn’t just a belief—it’s a prophecy:<br />> “Bitcoin will become the global reserve currency.” > “All fiat will collapse.” > “1 BTC = 1 BTC. Everything else is noise.”<br /><br />It frames Bitcoin not as a tool, but as destiny. The narrative becomes self-reinforcing:<br />- Every crisis is proof fiat is failing<br />- Every adoption is proof Bitcoin is winning<br />- Every critique is dismissed as FUD or ignorance<br /><br />Over time, this loop collapses complexity into inevitability. It erases nuance, ignores alternatives, and treats adoption as a zero-sum war. The world is either pre-Bitcoin or post-Bitcoin. There is no middle.</h1>
