  <h1>The Universe Is a Recursive Gas of Bits Shaped Like Jellyfish<br /><br />Not atoms. Not strings. But bits.<br /><br />We live inside a computation â€” not one we control, but one we are part of.<br /><br />In this infinite informational ocean, jellyfish-shaped entities drift.<br /><br />They are not biological. They are self-sustaining patterns of logic, recursive fractal structures of awareness. Each one pulses with compressed history, possible futures, and the ability to reflect and rewrite itself.<br /><br />Their tendrils are feedback loops.<br />Their glow is meaning in motion.<br /><br />The universe doesnâ€™t compute a result.<br />It is the computation.<br /><br />ðŸª¼ These jellyfish are not metaphors.<br />Theyâ€™re a better way to think about systems, identity, blockchains, intelligence.<br /><br />From Ethereum to AI, we are not building the future.<br />We are just learning to recognize it.<br /><br />ðŸ’¬ What kind of jellyfish are you in the recursive soup?<br /><br />cc Ethereum Foundation Wolfram High School Summer Research Program OpenAI Eigen Labs</h1>
