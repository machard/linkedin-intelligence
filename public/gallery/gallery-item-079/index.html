  <h1>🧠 Are We Unwitting Miners in the Attention Economy?  In Bitcoin, value emerges through Proof of Work. In social platforms, value is extracted through Proof of Distraction.  What if the patterns we follow online — the infinite scroll, the dopaminedriven loops, the ritualized engagement metrics — aren’t just side effects of entertainment, but the raw input of a system quietly harvesting cognitive cycles for someone else’s gain?  This is attention mining Not a metaphor, but a schema. Not passive consumption, but active submission to algorithmic induction.  Each like, each outrage, each ping — not noise, but signal. A protocol of ritual. A subconscious workforce.  ⚠️ The warning isn’t that your attention is being sold — it’s that it’s being calculated. Engineered. Shaped to feed architectures you never signed up to build.  Let’s explore alternatives. Let’s design systems where attention becomes sovereign signal, not collateral.   hashtag #AttentionMining  hashtag #SignalEcology  hashtag #SystemicRecalibration  hashtag #ProofOfDistraction  hashtag #CognitiveSovereignty</h1>
