  <h1>Respect the Ride When the Mind Goes Superluminal  Sometimes the unanchored brain takes a problem and ignites. Suddenly you’re surfing thought at lightspeed—patterns collapse, insight explodes. You’re limitless. Volatile. Alive.  But even supernovae need gravity. Because this ride—this recursive flame—consumes time, sleep, body. It bends the frame to stretch the field.  So if your mind goes luminous, negotiate your hours. Ride the current. Don’t drown in it.</h1>
