  <h1>Some thoughts behind the meme:<br /><br />Bitcoin was designed to be apolitical, but capital flows are never neutral.<br />When feeder mechanisms (like Tether or Saylor) push billions into BTC — and mining is concentrated in energy-rich, state-controlled territories — we should ask:<br /><br />Where does the loop go?<br /><br />Ethereum, despite its messiness, chooses to move forward.<br />Coordination under constraint is harder — but more human.</h1>
