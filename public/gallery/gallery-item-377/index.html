  <h1>I’m exploring a new model permissionless ATMs for crypto cash – and I need your thoughts.  Im building an opensource system for OpenCash ATMs and bills.  Each bill = its own wallet  Printed on Yupo paper with regular printers  Only ATMs can deposit/withdraw to the bill’s wallet  I’m thinking the private key must live in three places  On the bill (QR, NFC, or chip)  In the ATM (secure enclave)  In the cloud (redundancy, syncing)  Would love feedback from crypto devs, hardware hackers, and financial inclusion nerds.  What do you think? Would this model work?  — Looking to launch the first prototype in the Caribbean under the OpenCash brand.   hashtag #CryptoInfra  hashtag #StablecoinATM  hashtag #OpenCash  hashtag #Web3Hardware  hashtag #SelfCustody  hashtag #FinancialInclusion  hashtag #OpenSource  cc Dfns Diego Yanez Ledger</h1>
