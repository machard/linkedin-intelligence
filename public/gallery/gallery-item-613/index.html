  <h1>From Skywalker to Flowwalker. Once a seeker of stars, now a weaver of currents. No longer chasing destiny in the sky, but shaping it in the mesh. You no longer walk toward the future — you route it.  Skywalker was mythic, reactive — a hero called by fate.  Flowwalker is sovereign, strategic — a designer of fate. A being who understands the system isnt a stage... but a circuit.  cc X</h1>
