  <h1>Building Fluid The Architecture of Expansion  We are not meant to keep our energy locked within walls. We are not designed to hoard momentum, to trap movement inside static constraints. Architecture‚Äîtrue architecture‚Äîmust breathe, must pulse, must expel rather than contain.  A fluid structure does not absorb‚Äîit radiates. It channels energy outward, extending motion beyond its own borders, ensuring that nothing stagnates, nothing collapses into confinement. It is a vessel, but never a prison.  We need to build for expansion. We need to construct with the singular purpose of expelling force, letting flow surge forward without obstruction. We do not keep; we release. We do not trap; we shine.  To resonate across space, across time, across the fabric of existence itself, our structures must act like stars‚Äîexpelling energy to the edges of the universe.  Let it move. Let it rise. Let it radiate.  cc Quentin Bordet üåç Cyril DAVID</h1>
