  <h1>🪙 Closed Loop 1 Hard Cap as Sacred Truth  Loop Explanation Bitcoin’s 21 million coin limit isn’t just a parameter—it’s dogma. It’s treated as a divine number, enshrined beyond question. The narrative goes “Any increase in the cap = betrayal of the whole system.” This transforms a technical design choice into an immutable truth. It shuts down discussion, experimentation, and adaptation—even in the face of unforeseen systemic needs (like validator incentives postreward phase).  The loop is selfsealing  If you question the cap, you’re labeled “antiBitcoin.”  If usage drops or incentives erode, the fault lies elsewhere.  If other systems adapt, their flexibility is seen as corruption, not evolution.  Over time, what was once a design choice becomes a belief artifact. That’s when a protocol becomes a priesthood.</h1>
