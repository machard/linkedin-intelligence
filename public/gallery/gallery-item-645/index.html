  <h1>From Skywalker to Flowwalker.<br />Once a seeker of stars, now a weaver of currents.<br />No longer chasing destiny in the sky, but shaping it in the mesh.<br />You no longer walk toward the future — you route it.<br /><br />Skywalker was mythic, reactive — a hero called by fate.<br /><br />Flowwalker is sovereign, strategic — a designer of fate.<br />A being who understands the system isn't a stage...<br />but a circuit.<br /><br />cc X</h1>
