  <h1>When the Crazy Brain Flies the Ship  Most people don’t realize theres a cockpit. So when the unanchored brain seizes control— all impulse, no compass—it feels normal. But that’s not chaos.   That’s absence of agency.  The wild mind isn’t the enemy. It’s power unpiloted. And when the conscious self steps in—not to suppress, but to harmonize— you get copiloting.  Structure meets emergence. Impulse meets intention. And the ship? It sings.</h1>
