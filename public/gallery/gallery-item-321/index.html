  <h1>“The greatest captivity is thinking youre free because you inherited someone else’s script. Most people don’t think—they rerun. Most leaders don’t lead—they echo.”  A simple truth Narratives are ecosystems. And like ecosystems, they can thrive or rot. If youre not consciously choosing the narrative youre inside, chances are... youre serving someone elses.  Power doesn’t always wear a crown. It often whispers in familiar words, polished institutions, and carefully groomed ideologies. The cage feels safe when it’s been branded as virtue.  But here’s the call Work on your consciousness. Not just meditation apps and TED talks. I mean the real work—deprogramming inherited scripts, questioning reflexes, dismantling idols, and cultivating your sovereign signal.  You don’t need to become a hero. Just stop being a rerun.  Think for yourself. Sense for yourself. Reshape the collective field from the inside out.   hashtag #NarrativeAutonomy  hashtag #SovereignCognition  hashtag #SystemicAwakening  hashtag #FractalSovereignty  hashtag #ConsciousDesign</h1>
