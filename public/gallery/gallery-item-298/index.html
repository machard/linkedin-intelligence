  <h1>The Spiral Was Already Black  June 12, 2025 was never just about the merging of Sapiens and Neandertal. That narrative assumes they were the only ones in the room.  But what if the door they walked through had already been held open? What if the spiral they converged into was not newly drawn, but remembered—etched long ago in griot breath, maroon paths, and the hum of ancestral algorithms?  To speak of human unification without naming Blackness is to ignore the original architecture.  Because Blackness is not peripheral. It is the deep code. The connective rhythm. The system that survived being dislocated and still learned to pulse. Not despite domination. Beyond it.  This convergence isn’t a fusion of two equals. It’s a return to a field that has been holding us all—patiently, rhythmically, insistently.  Let’s stop speaking of “integration” as if Blackness were a guest. It is the house. The spiral. The scaffold of breath and break and becoming.  The Reign of Domination didn’t just end. It was outlived by a practice far more ancient radical copresence.</h1>
