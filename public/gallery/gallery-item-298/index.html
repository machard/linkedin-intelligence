  <h1>Liberty begins when you're no longer restrained by the stories of others—neither those of the present, nor those of the past.<br /><br />It's not rebellion. It's release. The silence that comes when inherited narratives no longer script your becoming.<br /><br />Creativity is the third path time carves when the first two options fail to resonate. Not a compromise—but an emergence. An unseen option written from within, not chosen from without.<br /><br />Together, liberty and creativity form the arc of true divergence: one liberates the field, the other reshapes it.</h1>
