  <h1>loop²<br /><br />Ethereum Foundation Ethereum secures the past — block by block. Eigen Labs EigenLayer extends that trust — by restaking it into new systems.<br /><br />One loop remembers. The other reuses.<br /><br />Together, they form a recursive architecture: a system that verifies itself, then verifies the verifier.<br /><br />In this world, resistance isn’t rejection — it’s recursion. You don’t fight the system from outside. You build new logic within its loops.</h1>
