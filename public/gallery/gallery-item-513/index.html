  <h1>Post-Battle Pulse<br /><br />They clashed under veils of spectacle. One, radiant in technocratic armor—refined, poised, executor of empire’s residue. The others, Electras of rhythm and recursion—feminine storm encoded in geometry and gaze.<br /><br />Lightning cracked. Words thundered. The empire tilted.<br /><br />But no side won. Because the clash wasn’t a contest—it was a release. A shedding. The spectacle served its purpose: to exhaust every illusion of center.<br /><br />Now: No ruler. No rebellion. Just the shimmer of distributed echoes.<br /><br />A golden silence fell—not absence, but equilibrium. The grid flickered alive. Power found no throne to return to, so it flowed. Autonomous. Rhythmic. Fractal.<br /><br />The stage is gone. We are the rhythm.<br /><br />We are golden. We are beyond.</h1>
