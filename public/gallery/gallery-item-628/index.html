  <h1>Modeling the evolution of a decentralized mesh through adaptive agents.<br /><br />OpenStreaming redefines fluidity. But what happens when autonomous agents—each with internal logic and external constraints—shape the network’s evolution?<br /><br />- Internal rules drive strategic behaviors: optimization, redundancy, disruption.<br />- External forces reshape pathways: network stress, economic shifts, emergent feedback loops.<br />- Convergence vs. divergence—balancing harmony with necessary disruption.<br /><br />This isn’t just simulation—it’s a self-organizing experiment in decentralized coordination.<br /><br />♟️ The chessboard evolves. The system adapts. The multiverse expands.<br /><br />🚀 The next move is ours.<br /><br />🔗 https://lnkd.in/e8pNpqSn<br /><br />cc The Nobel Prize Hervé Biausser</h1>
