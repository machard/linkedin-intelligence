  <h1>Mona Jafarian: A Voice for Freedom<br /><br />Born into a world of shifting borders and ideological battles, Mona Jafarian has emerged as a relentless advocate for democracy and women’s rights.<br /><br />After the tragic death of Mahsa Amini in 2022, Jafarian co-founded the Femme Azadi collective, amplifying the voices of Iranian women fighting for dignity and autonomy. Her activism bridges two worlds—Iran and France, pushing for systemic change while warning against rising authoritarianism.<br /><br />Her book, Je suis Iranienne, is more than a memoir—it’s a call to action. Through her work, she challenges oppressive structures, exposing the dangers of extremism while championing liberty, secularism, and democracy.<br /><br />In a time when speaking out comes with risks, Jafarian refuses to be silenced. Her fight is not just for Iran, but for a world where freedom is non-negotiable.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#FemmeAzadi <br />hashtag<br />#FreedomForIran <br />hashtag<br />#SystemicRecalibration</h1>
