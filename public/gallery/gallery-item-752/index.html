  <h1>Consciousness is the combinaison of the universe with your unique brain pattern<br /><br />Your brain pattern is the result of DNA (initial state) and the continuous processing of your reality which continuously modify its pattern (state).<br /><br />Each tick of reality processed by your brain gives a new state to your brain<br /><br />state(brain, t) = state(brain, t-1) + reality(t)<br />state(brain, 0) = f(DNA)<br /><br />Each of us experiences reality in its unique way from its unique point of view.<br /><br />2 different brain patterns experiencing the same reality will experience it differently because they don't have the same starting pattern.<br /><br />We then regroup in a human p2p network to collect wider, remember, and also SHAPE our collective story as efficiently as possible.<br /><br />We need to build the most extended human network possible to understand and impact the universe as much as possible through our story AND with the help of our tech.<br /><br />Quantum physics allows direct editing of reality.<br />Ethereum is the infinite value network that can support the infinite human network.<br />ChatGPT, Grok, and co and social networks help distribute and maintain knowledge and perspectives.<br /><br />At some point the creator of the universe will notice and communicate with us.<br /><br />cc CentraleSupélec Stanford University École Polytechnique University of Waterloo INSEAD Nanyang Technological University Singapore</h1>
