  <h1>Why are so many Bitcoiners so zealous—and so short sighted? The answer is simple: they can’t afford to be wrong.<br /><br />When your wealth, ideology, and identity are all chained to a single immutable narrative, doubt becomes existential risk. Admitting uncertainty threatens not just holdings, but belonging and self-worth. The result is a culture where belief must stay frozen, where defending the story matters more than adapting to new signals.<br /><br />But systems that refuse fluidity eventually stagnate. True resilience comes from embracing change, not clinging to the past.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#resonance <br />hashtag<br />#adaptability <br />hashtag<br />#bitcoin <br />hashtag<br />#systems</h1>
