  <h1>🔵 **Why Bitcoin’s Ice Won’t Last Forever**  Strategy Bitcoin is often celebrated as an immutable bedrock — a digital glacier immune to change. But in complex systems, rigidity can be a warning sign, not proof of strength.  As the world—and its narratives—grow warmer, Bitcoin’s frozen structure struggles to adapt. The relentless defense of its unyielding “ice” incurs both social and economic friction. Systems that refuse to melt, to flow and reshape, risk fracturing when resonance shifts.  True value isn’t found in eternal preservation, but in the ability to absorb entropy, transform, and reemerge more fluid. When belief freezes, movement slows. And slow systems fade.  🌊 The next era belongs to those willing to let old ice melt—inviting new patterns, new flows, and a deeper freedom.   hashtag #resonance  hashtag #bitcoin  hashtag #systemicfluidity  hashtag #change</h1>
