  <h1>Not all sound is signal. Not all energy is expression.  Bitcoin defends itself with repetition. Block by block. Belief by belief. But repetition without receptivity becomes noise. A loop sealed from feedback. Immune to the pulse of the world.  Ethereum with EigenLayer invites resonance. It doesn’t just broadcast — it listens, recoordinates, responds. A network attuned to signal, not just volume.  Noise defends itself. Signal reconfigures the system.</h1>
