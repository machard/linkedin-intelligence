  <h1>📣 [Update] Facebook Ads &#43; LinkedIn Experiments – What I’ve Learned So Far  I started running two simple Facebook ads targeting the francophonie, each pointing to a LinkedIn article. I didn’t overthink it — no custom creatives, just letting Facebook use LinkedIns metadata.  Here are the early results (see image)   ➡️ 347 total clicks  ➡️ €0.01 per click  ➡️ Articles  • Ethereum and Reality  • The Infinite Human Network  🧪 Next steps  Since LinkedIn doesnt support tracking pixels or scroll depth, I’m exploring external hosting for deeper engagement insights (like where readers drop off per chapter).  But for now — keeping it simple, cheap, and focused on learning.  👉 If you’ve done similar tests or have advice on frictionless analytics setups, I’m all ears.</h1>
