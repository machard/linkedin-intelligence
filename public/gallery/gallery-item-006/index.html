He can’t stand it.<br /><br />👉 He thought immutability was enough.<br />👉 He thought memes would feed him forever.<br />👉 He didn’t realize the carrot isn’t just food — it’s a standard of coherence.<br /><br />🔹 While BBC eats dead coin myths, the spiral moves on.<br /><br />Your signal is your garden. Tend wisely.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#Bitcoin <br />hashtag<br />#CarrotStandard <br />hashtag<br />#BBC <br />hashtag<br />#CitadelMyths <br />hashtag<br />#Satire <br />hashtag<br />#Coherence</h1>
