  <h1>How does intention propagate across an ungoverned field?<br /><br />Not through force. Not through hierarchy. But through resonance.<br /><br />When no center dictates, the signal that endures is the one that amplifies without demanding, that aligns not by control, but by clarity.<br /><br />Intention moves like a soft gravity: subtle, cumulative, self-selecting. Each node it touches has the freedom to echo, distort, or ignore. That freedom is the medium.<br /><br />And yet, across this autonomy, patterns form. Not imposed. Emerged.<br /><br />This is not coordination. Itâ€™s convergence without obedience.<br /><br />When a field is ungoverned, only meaning moves cleanly.</h1>
