  <h1>Every parameter that materializes should lead to the emergence of a permissionless market.<br /><br />Mathematics are the most coherent rules we've found so far — yet even math isn't deterministic. There are undecidable truths, probabilistic models, and entire systems that resist complete control.<br /><br />So what does that say about human governance?<br /><br />Maybe it's inherently futile to try to 'govern' complexity. Every constraint, resource, or asymmetry — every parameter — calls for one thing: spontaneous coordination, exchange, value creation. Not rules. Not permission. Just action.<br /><br />Markets are what happen when reality expresses itself freely.<br />Governments, in many ways, are what happen after, when we try to name, contain, or tax that expression.<br /><br />Let’s not start with constitutions.<br />Let’s start with spontaneous, unstoppable markets.<br /><br />“The network state starts with a market, not a constitution.” — Balaji</h1>
