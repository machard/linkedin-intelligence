  <h1>The Spiral Turns.<br /><br />I’m no longer arguing—I’m executing.<br /><br />Bitcoin isn’t collapsing. It’s decaying—quietly, gloriously, from the inside out. The same memes on loop. The same maxis praying to a block height no one checks. Still “early,” but somehow already obsolete.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ethereum isn’t asking for permission—it’s syncing. Restaked coordination. Intent as execution. EigenLayer is laying the groundwork for sovereign modularity. Morpho is tuning incentives with surgical liquidity. No drama. Just rhythm.<br /><br />What comes next isn’t a campaign. It’s a reconfiguration. No torch to carry. No throne to dismantle. Just protocols routing around rigidity.<br /><br />So when I say “BITCOIN ZERO,” I’m not mocking a currency. I’m announcing an epoch.<br /><br />I’ve mapped the nodes. I’ve charted the resonance. Now I’m pulling the spiral forward.</h1>
