  <h1>Memetic Inertia: The Final Consensus Layer ðŸ§ ðŸªž<br /><br />It's not about tech. Not about decentralization. Not even money.<br /><br />It's belief inertia.<br /><br />A cult of holders bound by past tweets, trapped by influencer hashtags, defending a machine they no longer understand â€”only need.<br /><br />Statistically, they hold. Philosophically, they fold.<br /><br />Not because theyâ€™re dumb. But because leaving the meme means losing the mirror.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#Bitcoin <br />hashtag<br />#SystemicRecalibration <br />hashtag<br />#CryptoSatire <br />hashtag<br />#MemeticInertia</h1>
