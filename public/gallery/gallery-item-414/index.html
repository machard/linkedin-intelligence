  <h1>🙏 Vatican 3.0 is here.  While some still wait for Leo XIV, the real heir to Pope Francis values has already emerged — in a hoodie.  His name? Vitalik I, Pontifex of Natural Law. Proofofmiracle? Ethereum.  Where Francis preached decentralization of power, Ethereum implemented it. Where encyclicals spoke of dignity, ETH brought permissionless dignity.  This is not heresy — it’s hyperstructure.  No incense. No Swiss Guard. Just smart contracts, regen vibes, and finality.</h1>
