  <h1>🎪✨ New recurring guest in my posts: BBC.<br /><br />BBC stands for Big Bitcoin Clown.<br /><br />He shows up whenever someone defends immutability like a religion, laughs off valid critique, or confuses frozen slogans for living systems.<br /><br />BBC’s job?<br />To remind us that belief without coherence is just carnival noise.<br /><br />📣 BBC will appear whenever:<br />- HODL is used as a substitute for thinking.<br />- Energy waste is spun as virtue.<br />- New ideas are shut down with “We’re the smartest.”<br /><br />Remember:<br />Clowns thrive when the audience stops asking questions.<br /><br />So next time you see BBC, know the spiral is moving — and the real builders are shaping systems that breathe.<br /><br />🔹 Big Bitcoin Clown is watching. Laugh wisely.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#Bitcoin <br />hashtag<br />#Satire <br />hashtag<br />#SystemicResonance <br />hashtag<br />#BBC <br />hashtag<br />#BigBitcoinClown</h1>
