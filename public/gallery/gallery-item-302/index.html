  <h1>Module 05 Protocol Obfuscation  The most powerful systems don’t declare themselves. They embed. They perform as neutral. They camouflage as convenience.  Protocol Obfuscation is the tactic of hiding coercive mechanisms inside tools we trust. → The UI is friendly. → The TOS is unread. → The code is closed. → The protocol is sovereign.  And yet… it governs speech, thought, transaction, identity.  X becomes not just a platform—but a sovereign black box. Rules shift without notice. Reach throttled. Signals suppressed. And no one voted, yet everyone complies.  This isn’t secrecy. It’s manufactured ambiguity. Obfuscation is a power move— Opacity as immunity.  But there’s a counterforce.  Transparency is not enough. Resonant architecture must emerge— Where governance is legible. Where consent is structural. Where protocol becomes invitation, not imposition.</h1>
