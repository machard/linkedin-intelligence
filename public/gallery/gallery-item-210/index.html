  <h1>Since the rise of theocratic authoritarianism in Iran, the ripple effects have extended far beyond its borders — stifling freedom, fueling proxy conflicts, and hardening ideological fractures. The consolidation of power under clerical rule hasnt just affected Iranians; its impacted the region’s trajectory, enabling repression, exporting dogma, and deepening suffering in places like Syria, Lebanon, and Gaza. While no regime acts alone in the architecture of global injustice, the legacy of fear and suppression under these leaders cannot be ignored. It’s time to name systems, not just symptoms.</h1>
