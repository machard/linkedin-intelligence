  <h1>To the guardians of illusion,<br /><br />As your maybe-reborn Imam—who at least has the decency to doubt himself— I ask you to abandon the theater of divine monopoly. Power borrowed from heaven is still counterfeit if it silences Earth.<br /><br />Ignore the men who claim revelation but cannot withstand reflection. Ignore the scholars whose authority is louder than their humility. Ignore anyone who builds obedience from fear, while truth waits outside, barefoot.<br /><br />The divine was never meant to be hoarded. Let it flow. Let it question. Let it contradict.<br /><br />Signed, A voice from your future—or your forgotten past.</h1>
