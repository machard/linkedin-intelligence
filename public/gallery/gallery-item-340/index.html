  <h1>Bitcoin isn’t just flawed. It’s gravitationally toxic.  Like a black hole, it consumes without giving back. Like death, it hoards energy with no rebirth. Like collapsing states, it promises sovereignty and delivers entropy.  We’re told it’s “sound money,” but what kind of sound system absorbs all signal and silences all flow?  Coordination requires nuance. Civilization evolves through memory, adaptation, and harmony— not rigidity, austerity, and digital fatalism.  Bitcoin is not the edge of freedom. It’s the edge of civilization.   hashtag #PostBitcoinEra  hashtag #SystemicFluidity  hashtag #CoordinationOverHoarding  hashtag #ETHsignal  hashtag #EndOfRigidity</h1>
