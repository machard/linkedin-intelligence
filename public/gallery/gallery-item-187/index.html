  <h1>Thoughts Are Statistically Predictable  In a world saturated with data, even thoughts cast shadows.  When brain wallets were looted in seconds, it wasn’t mindreading—it was statistical clairvoyance. Predictable phrases. Familiar quotes. Patterns etched by culture, language, and habit.  What we imagine to be ourselves—our passwords, preferences, and beliefs—are often just derivatives of shared templates. And those templates are being mapped, monetized, and modeled at scale.  This isn’t paranoia. It’s signal analysis.  Our thoughts echo across algorithms that learn faster than we reflect, nudging decisions before we’re aware we’re choosing. And so the question isn’t whether your cognition is private. It’s whether it’s still sovereign.  Defending against this isn’t just about better encryption. It’s about reclaiming the imagination—the unpredictable, the poetic, the fractal divergences that escape probabilistic capture.  In an age of cognitive commodification, novelty is resistance.</h1>
