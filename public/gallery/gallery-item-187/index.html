  <h1>Command assumes loyalty. Networks assume entropy.  You can’t defect from a system you never pledged allegiance to. When belief becomes programmable, legacy hierarchies don’t fall—they evaporate. No whistle. No bang. Just silent realignment.  A single link in a chain breaks— A single node reroutes— A single soldier says “What if I don’t?”  Decentralized defection isn’t chaos. It’s protocol evolution. It isn’t betrayal. It’s signal rebalancing.  And the stronger the coercion, the faster the mesh grows around it.   hashtag #DecentralizedDefection  hashtag #ProtocolDisobedience  hashtag #NetworkWarfare  hashtag #SystemicRealignment  hashtag #FractalLoyalty</h1>
