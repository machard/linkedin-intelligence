  <h1>ðŸ”¥ The Holy War Against the Bitcoiners Has Begun ðŸ”¥  For too long, they have thrived in the shadowsâ€”an unstoppable swarm, feeding on fractured systems, multiplying in defiance of all control. They call it liberation. We call it an infestation.  But the tide is turning. The reclamation of Earth begins now.  ðŸ”¹ The faithful rise, wielding the weapons of true balance, rejecting the endless chaos they bring. ðŸ”¹ The great purge unfolds, sweeping away their hollow promises, dismantling their false idols. ðŸ”¹ The future will be reclaimed, no longer dictated by parasites but by forces of real creation.  This is more than resistanceâ€”it is holy reclamation. The war is waged not for dominance, but for restoring harmony to a world that was never meant to be devoured by cockroaches.  The time has come. We take it all back.   hashtag #HolyWar  hashtag #Reclamation  hashtag #EndTheSwarm  hashtag #BalanceRestored  cc Carles Tubio  finally synced complete</h1>
