  <h1>ðŸ§  Dementia isnâ€™t just memory loss. Itâ€™s fragmented meaning.  Imagine trying to tell a story â€” but the pages are out of order. Some are missing. Some are from another book entirely. So the brain starts to fill the gaps. It improvises.  Thatâ€™s what dementia often feels like Not forgetting everything â€” but trying to make sense of what remains.  ðŸ”¹ A familiar face you canâ€™t name. ðŸ”¹ A room youâ€™ve always known, suddenly foreign. ðŸ”¹ A sentence you begin with certaintyâ€¦ then lose.  Itâ€™s terrifying. Itâ€™s human. Itâ€™s misunderstood.  We need to talk about it not just as a disease, but as an altered experience of reality.  Letâ€™s bring more clarity, empathy, and innovation to how we treat â€” and live with â€” dementia.   hashtag #MentalHealth  hashtag #Neuroscience  hashtag #Aging  hashtag #DementiaAwareness  hashtag #HumanExperience  hashtag #Empathy  hashtag #HealthcareInnovation</h1>
