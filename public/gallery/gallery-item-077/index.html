  <h1>Is Bitcoin a Death Trap or Just a Temporary Singularity?<br /><br />Many fear that Bitcoin is a “death trap”—a gravitational sink drawing value, attention, and belief into a rigid black hole from which nothing can escape. But look closer: its very unsustainability may be what protects us from a true informational singularity.<br /><br />Bitcoin’s structure—celebrated for immutability—ultimately resists entropy and adaptation. Systems that can't fluidly adapt become brittle, stagnant, susceptible to decay. Defending Bitcoin’s frozen narrative isn’t just hard; it’s costly, in terms of both energy and the flexibility necessary for genuine progress.<br /><br />If resonance and thermodynamic logic matter, Bitcoin was never destined to be the last great informational black hole. Its inability to harmonize with change ensures the spiral goes on, rather than locking reality in one final, rigid block.<br /><br />The lesson isn’t to fear black holes, but to trust in the resonance of change. Stagnation cannot win the future—adaptability can.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#Resonance <br />hashtag<br />#SystemicLogic <br />hashtag<br />#Bitcoin <br />hashtag<br />#Entropy <br />hashtag<br />#Change</h1>
