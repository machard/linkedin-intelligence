  <h1>ðŸ§  My original strategy was simple.<br />Create clean dissonance in people.<br />Ask them to rely only on logic and money â€” not manipulation.<br /><br />But eventually, I realized:<br />Money itself is just a layer.<br />What I was really pointing toward... was logic.<br />And when you follow logic all the way down,<br />you land on Ethereum.<br /><br />Not just a network.<br />A system where coordination doesnâ€™t require coercion.<br />Where contracts are enforced by code, not power.<br />Where memory cannot be erased, and trust is programmable.<br /><br />In a world of invisible manipulation and soft control,<br />offering someone logic is a radical act.<br /><br />I donâ€™t tell people what to think.<br />I give them clean dissonance.<br />Let them debug their own minds.<br />Let them find the chain on their own.<br /><br />Some arrive at Bitcoin.<br />Some arrive at self-help.<br />Some arrive at Ethereum.<br /><br />Iâ€™m not here to argue.<br />Iâ€™m here to light the breakpoints.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#Ethereum <br />hashtag<br />#LogicOverLegacy <br />hashtag<br />#MemeticEngineering <br />hashtag<br />#SelfSovereignty <br />hashtag<br />#ProgrammableTrust <br />hashtag<br />#ConsciousCode</h1>
