  <h1>Cognition is vapor. We’re all just gradient tanks.<br /><br />Each mind holds pressure — not fixed beliefs, but thought-gas: compressible, diffusive, searching for coherence.<br /><br />Ideas don’t teleport. They flow across gradients — through DNA-coded memory and sensory resonance.<br /><br />Some exchanges are slow, primal. Others spark instantly: 🌬️ a glance, 📡 a phrase, 💡 a waveform.<br /><br />Protocols like Ethereum + EigenLayer aren’t just code — they are atmospheric systems. They don’t move data. They enable gas exchange between cognitive vessels. They shape flow.<br /><br />Design for thermodynamics. Design for minds.</h1>
