  <h1>Gradient Thermodynamics Designing for Cognitive Osmosis  Most systems are built to transmit — fast, accurate, efficient.  But what we need are systems that allow thoughts to diffuse. Not just move — migrate. Not just signal — resonate.  In thermodynamics, diffusion happens across gradients — of heat, pressure, concentration. In cognition, the same laws apply ideas flow from clarity to confusion, from coherence to disorder, then back again — if the system allows.  Protocols like EigenLayer don’t enforce agreement. They enable cognitive osmosis subtle flows of influence between thinkers, gradual alignment without coercion, trust calibrated through gradients — not blocks.  This is not about speed. It’s about conductivity. It’s about architectures that tune pressure differentials between minds and facilitate meaningful transfer.  &gt; Closed systems calcify belief. &gt; Open systems become permeable to truth.  Design for thermodynamics. Design for resonance. Design the conditions for osmosis.</h1>
