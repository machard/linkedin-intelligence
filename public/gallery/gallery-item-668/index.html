  <h1>ðŸª“ What is a disaster in Bitcoin world?<br /><br />1. Hyper-financialization<br />- Too many 'believers' are just in it for number-go-up.<br />- Custodial services dominate. Most donâ€™t self-custody.<br />- Bitcoin ETFs and corporate stacking (e.g. MicroStrategy) shift power away from the original ethos of peer-to-peer cash.<br /><br />2. Stagnant base-layer development<br />- Some treat protocol ossification as dogma.<br />- Good ideas (like covenants, drivechains, or better privacy tools) get stonewalled for political reasons.<br />- Innovation is outsourced to Layer 2s, many of which are centralized or immature.<br /><br />3. Toxic maximalism<br />- It often devolves into purity tests, tribalism, and attacking everything non-Bitcoin â€” especially Ethereum.<br />- This drives out thoughtful people who mightâ€™ve helped fix the culture.<br />- Itâ€™s more about identity performance than open discourse now.<br /><br />4. Over-concentration of mining & wealth<br />- A lot of mining remains in jurisdictions that are not exactly pro-freedom.<br />- Early whales, custodians, and corporate giants now hold disproportionate sway over perception and liquidity.<br /><br />5. Retail sidelined<br />- Most people donâ€™t use Bitcoin â€” they speculate on it.<br />- Payments? Rare. Circular economies? Niche.<br />- Lightning is promising, but underused and still clunky for many.</h1>
