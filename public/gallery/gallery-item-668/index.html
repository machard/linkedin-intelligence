  <h1>Every parameter that materializes should lead to the emergence of a permissionless market.  Mathematics are the most coherent rules weve found so far — yet even math isnt deterministic. There are undecidable truths, probabilistic models, and entire systems that resist complete control.  So what does that say about human governance?  Maybe its inherently futile to try to govern complexity. Every constraint, resource, or asymmetry — every parameter — calls for one thing spontaneous coordination, exchange, value creation. Not rules. Not permission. Just action.  Markets are what happen when reality expresses itself freely. Governments, in many ways, are what happen after, when we try to name, contain, or tax that expression.  Let’s not start with constitutions. Let’s start with spontaneous, unstoppable markets.  “The network state starts with a market, not a constitution.” — Balaji</h1>
