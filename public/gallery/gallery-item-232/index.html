  <h1>ðŸ“‰ There Will Be No Exit  The faith is strongâ€”until it isnâ€™t. Until one whale sells. Then another. Then everyone.  You told yourself youd never panic. You believed in diamond hands. In scarcity. In the halving. But markets donâ€™t care what you believe.  They care about liquidity. And when the selling starts, it vanishes.  The bids disappear. The floors dissolve. And youâ€™re not early anymoreâ€”youâ€™re alone, in freefall, trying to exit a belief system with no door.  Because hereâ€™s the truth  Youâ€™re not trading an asset. Youâ€™re trapped inside a story.  And that story is unwindingâ€”tick by tick, wallet by wallet.</h1>
