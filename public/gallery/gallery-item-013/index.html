  <h1>Why are so many Bitcoiners so zealous—and so short sighted? The answer is simple they can’t afford to be wrong.  When your wealth, ideology, and identity are all chained to a single immutable narrative, doubt becomes existential risk. Admitting uncertainty threatens not just holdings, but belonging and selfworth. The result is a culture where belief must stay frozen, where defending the story matters more than adapting to new signals.  But systems that refuse fluidity eventually stagnate. True resilience comes from embracing change, not clinging to the past.   hashtag #resonance  hashtag #adaptability  hashtag #bitcoin  hashtag #systems</h1>
