  <h1>🚀 Bitcoin The New Corporate Rite of Passage? 🥸  Remember when climbing the career ladder meant mastering Excel macros or surviving your first team offsite? Well, thats so 2015. Today’s rite of passage buying Bitcoin, holding through a dip, and explaining your investment thesis to your skeptical aunt at Thanksgiving.  Initiation goes like this 1. “It’s digital gold!” you proclaim, eyes shimmering with hope. 2. Market dips 30%. Existential reflection intensifies. 3. You Google “What is a seed phrase?” at 2am. 4. You tweet diamond hands, but your palms are sweating. 5. Eventually, you emerge not rich, but now fluent in both memes and monetary policy.  Congrats, you’re through the spiral. Next step create a meme to prove it.    hashtag #CryptoCulture  hashtag #RiteOfPassage  hashtag #ResonantFinance</h1>
