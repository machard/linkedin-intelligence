  <h1>🚨 Bitcoin Has Peaked: The End of an Arc 🚨<br /><br />After touching $115K in 2025, Bitcoin isn’t crashing — it’s converging.<br /><br />This isn’t a selloff. It’s a return to baseline.<br /><br />For 15 years, BTC was an emerging belief structure riding the wave of:<br />🌐 exponential internet adoption<br />💸 capital liquidity and risk-seeking behavior<br />🧠 increasing fluency in decentralized abstraction<br /><br />But as of 2025, the coordination substrate has saturated:<br />- Over 70% of the global population is online<br />- The narrative has reached peak memetic circulation<br />- Capital is rebalancing toward new primitives (ETH restaking, AI-token hybrids, ecological assets)<br /><br />BTC didn’t fail. It fulfilled its arc.<br /><br />Its price action now resembles a decaying wave — not from collapse, but from completion.<br /><br />Just like MySpace, Napster, or AltaVista, it opened the door — and then stepped aside.<br /><br />The question isn’t “what’s next for BTC?” It’s “what new signal rises now?”<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#Bitcoin <br />hashtag<br />#PostPeak <br />hashtag<br />#CryptoCycles <br />hashtag<br />#SystemicRecalibration <br />hashtag<br />#TruthArc <br />hashtag<br />#MarketNarratives <br />hashtag<br />#BTC2025</h1>
