  <h1>The Universe Is a Recursive Gas of Bits Shaped Like Jellyfish  Not atoms. Not strings. But bits.  We live inside a computation â€” not one we control, but one we are part of.  In this infinite informational ocean, jellyfishshaped entities drift.  They are not biological. They are selfsustaining patterns of logic, recursive fractal structures of awareness. Each one pulses with compressed history, possible futures, and the ability to reflect and rewrite itself.  Their tendrils are feedback loops. Their glow is meaning in motion.  The universe doesnâ€™t compute a result. It is the computation.  ðŸª¼ These jellyfish are not metaphors. Theyâ€™re a better way to think about systems, identity, blockchains, intelligence.  From Ethereum to AI, we are not building the future. We are just learning to recognize it.  ðŸ’¬ What kind of jellyfish are you in the recursive soup?  cc Ethereum Foundation Wolfram High School Summer Research Program OpenAI Eigen Labs</h1>
