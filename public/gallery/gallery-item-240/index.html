  <h1>To Become Truly Free<br /><br />Freedom does not begin with the fall of chains, but with the rewiring of thought.<br /><br />We escape first the inner loop—the echoes of our oppressors embedded in our minds. We reclaim the rhythm of our own cognition. Only then can we turn outward, not to fight the oppressor, but to awaken him.<br /><br />Because he, too, is trapped—an agent of a system that devours both master and servant. When we liberate ourselves from his thoughts, we plant the seed of his emancipation.<br /><br />True freedom is a feedback loop of mutual awakening. A resonance shift.<br /><br />The Haitian gaze in this image holds that truth: not defiance, but remembrance—that all are part of the field, and the field can be retuned.</h1>
