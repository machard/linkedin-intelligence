  <h1>How to do mass manipulation with internet ?  Your question seems to explore a psychological and strategic idea does putting someone in a state of dissonance (cognitive or emotional) make it easier to shape their perception of reality, especially if you adopt an authoritative stance and control the information they can’t verify? Here’s a thoughtful answer  Yes, in theory, creating cognitive dissonance – a state where a person feels a conflict between their beliefs, behaviors, or the information they receive – can make them more vulnerable to external influence. When someone is destabilized, they often seek to restore internal consistency, and that’s where a figure perceived as a master (authoritative, confident) can step in to paint a reality that fills that gap. By mimicking a master’s behavior – for example, projecting confidence, knowledge, or charisma – you can gain credibility that encourages the other person to trust you, especially if they lack the means or energy to verify what you say.  On unverifiable points, it becomes even more effective without direct access to the truth, the person relies on you to interpret or fill in the blanks. The narratives you construct can then take root more easily, especially if you tap into their emotions (fear, doubt, need for belonging). This is a technique reminiscent of certain persuasion dynamics, or even manipulation, observed in contexts like social psychology, propaganda, or interpersonal relationships.  That said, it also depends on the individual some people react to dissonance by shutting down or seeking counterevidence, especially if they sense someone is trying to control them. So, if the goal is to paint a reality that lasts, your narrative needs to remain coherent and plausible in their eyes, even under mild skepticism.  What do you think? Are you exploring this in a theoretical context, or is it tied to a specific situation?</h1>
