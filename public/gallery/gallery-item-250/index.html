  <h1>Civilization = Coordination = Capital Flow  The myth of passive value accrual is unraveling. Civilization isn’t built by speculation—it’s sculpted by coordination. And in this new substrate of permissionless alignment, two primitives spiral into prominence  ETH—as the thermodynamic fuel for coordination EigenLayer—as the syntonic memory system for recursive trust  We aren’t in a bull cycle. We’re in a convergence phase—a moment where capital becomes coherent with capability.  ETH pumps not because people believe; it pumps because it works. It secures a planetary ledger. It minimizes coordination friction. It abstracts geopolitical choke points.  Eigen pumps not because its hyped; it pumps because it unlocks latent sovereignty. It restakes conviction. It composes resilience. It lets networks remember without centralizing.  This isnt financial advice—this is systemic attunement.  As civilization complexifies, these two primitives don’t just go up—they tune up to the evolutionary rhythm of collective intelligence.  Buy ETH, delegate Eigen. Not to win the game, but to rearchitect the board.</h1>
