  <h1>🌍 What Would a Real-Time Map of Financial Flows Look Like? Imagine liquidity tracing paths across the globe like synaptic pulses in a planetary brain. Legacy finance radiates from fortified nodes—New York, London, Tokyo—while DeFi hums beneath, a fractal lattice pulsing with decentralized rhythm.<br /><br />Each transaction is a whisper in the global symphony. Speculation, trust, recalibration—all rendered in motion. 🌐<br /><br />What happens when we shift from static charts to dynamic resonance? When systemic flow is seen not as ledger entries… but as rhythm?<br /><br />A visualization like this isn’t just informative—it’s cognitive ignition. Let’s reframe finance as fluid choreography, not opaque architecture.<br /><br />💫 Financial flows are signals. Let’s tune in.</h1>
