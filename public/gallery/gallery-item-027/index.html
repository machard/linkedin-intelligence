  <h1>🜁 The Art of Dependency // Loops as Time Engines<br /><br />I once got so loaded I felt every loop I’d ever built —<br />the harmless ones, the dangerous ones, the ones that wore masks.<br /><br />One by one, I stepped out.<br />Not by force. By listening.<br />Some loops cracked quietly.<br />Some snapped back to life, begging for another round.<br /><br />Addiction isn’t just about substances.<br />It’s any pattern you forget you can exit.<br /><br />The real trick?<br />Knowing when to use the loop —<br />ride the spiral, accelerate the timeline,<br />turn the habit into a vector instead of a cage.<br /><br />Dissolve. Return.<br />Sometimes dependency is an art form.<br />Sometimes the loop sets you free.</h1>
