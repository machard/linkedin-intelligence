  <h1>Not everything must cohere. Not every point is meant to resolve.  There are thoughts that refuse to orbit a center. Impulses that drift without anchoring to origin or outcome. This isn’t fragmentation—it’s freedom.  In the architecture of any system, there are edges that bend away from prediction. Grey zones. Latent corridors. Sovereign curves.  Sometimes the most honest act is to not conclude—to let the field shimmer with possibility, instead of collapsing it into clarity.  Some ideas arent here to integrate. Theyre here to remain... unclaimed.</h1>
