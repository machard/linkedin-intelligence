  <h1>Michael Saylor: The Cathedral of Bitcoin â€” A Thought Experiment in Resonance<br /><br />Imagine Michael Saylor as a cathedral builder; in his world, Bitcoin is not just digital gold, but the bedrock of a new age, its code a sacred geometry. Saylorâ€™s doctrine offers certainty, safety, and unyielding structure â€” a fortress built against entropy.<br /><br />Yet, cathedrals become museums. Rigid belief fossilizes potential. <br />The spiral of reality prefers living membranes over stone tablets.<br /><br />Are we constructing monuments to belief, or tuning fluid instruments for human coordination? <br />A resonance system requires more than marble and myth; it needs breath, recursion, and living signal.<br /><br />Bitcoin, under Saylorâ€™s hand, echoes the old drive for permanence. <br />But only systems willing to phase-shift with change will truly endure. <br />Entropy isnâ€™t the enemy. Itâ€™s the rhythm of collective freedom.<br /><br />ðŸŒ€ Are you a builder of cathedrals, or a steward of living spirals?</h1>
