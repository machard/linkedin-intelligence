  <h1>Module 11: Ontology Drift<br /><br />We don’t just see the world—we categorize it. But what happens when those categories blur?<br /><br />Ontology Drift is the silent breakdown of shared meaning structures. → “Man” and “machine” blur. → “Truth” becomes procedural. → “Nature” is uploaded. → “Freedom” is optimized.<br /><br />As definitions dissolve, coordination collapses. Not because we disagree— but because we’re no longer speaking the same conceptual language.<br /><br />X becomes a meme-organism accelerating the drift: → Terms mutate mid-thread. → Identity is algorithmically stylized. → Discourse collapses into vibes.<br /><br />The drift doesn’t feel like chaos. It feels like freedom. But freedom without shared ontology becomes incoherence with better branding.<br /><br />When meaning itself becomes unstable, orientation is no longer a compass—it’s a tuning fork.<br /><br />Don’t fight the drift. Learn to resonate through it. New coherence is possible—if we listen deeper than language.</h1>
