  <h1>Module 07: Trust Collapse<br /><br />Trust is the invisible scaffolding of every system. Once it cracks, collapse isn’t loud—it’s cascading.<br /><br />Trust Collapse begins slowly, then all at once: → Fact-checkers become suspect. → Experts lose legitimacy. → Platforms eat their own credibility. → Signals blur, and doubt becomes default.<br /><br />This isn’t just about lies. It’s about institutional entropy—where each contradiction, each shadow ban, each silent tweak erodes the architecture of belief.<br /><br />X under Elon Musk accelerates this collapse. Transparency is performative. <br />Rules are unstable. Moderation is unpredictable. Users become test subjects in real-time.<br /><br />When trust evaporates, two responses emerge:<br /><br />Retreat into tribal enclaves.<br /><br />Seek coherence beyond the noise.<br /><br />But real coherence isn’t imposed—it’s emergent. It comes from aligned intent, visible protocol, and mutual accountability. Not force. Not persuasion. Not virality.<br /><br />Collapse isn’t the end—it’s a clearing. What we reweave next decides everything.</h1>
