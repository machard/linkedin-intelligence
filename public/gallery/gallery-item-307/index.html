  <h1>Narrative Entropy 🌀🧠📉<br /><br />At first, the story is clean: sound money, fixed supply, digital gold.<br /><br />But questions come. Contradictions stack. Patches are added. Footnotes pile up.<br /><br />Then it splinters: “Actually, it’s a payments network.” “No, it’s a store of value.” “Wait, it’s a state-resistant base layer.” “Just zoom out.”<br /><br />Each answer creates two new questions. Each justification adds heat and accelerates the collapse.<br /><br />In the end, they don't believe the narrative. They just repeat it so it doesn't stop existing.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#Bitcoin <br />hashtag<br />#SystemicRecalibration <br />hashtag<br />#NarrativeEntropy <br />hashtag<br />#CognitiveTraps <br />hashtag<br />#CryptoSatire</h1>
