  <h1>We didn’t just inherit our genes. We wrote the stories that selected them.  In classic Darwinism, traits emerge by chance and environments select them based on survival and reproduction. But in human societies, we’ve added a twist.  We create ideals. We tell stories about speed, beauty, intelligence, leadership. We design institutions, markets, and incentives around these narratives. Then, generation after generation, we reward the people who match them.  The result? A subtle form of cultural eugenics. Not enforced by law, but by stories. Not imposed by the state, but by consensus and admiration.  It’s not that running fast helps you survive. It’s that we decided running fast is valuable. And then we built a world where fast runners thrive, get funding, get visibility—and pass on their genes or influence.  We flipped Darwinism on its head. We don’t just adapt to environments. We shape environments that select for the traits we admire.  Selection isnt natural anymore. Its narrativedriven.  cc Rethoric Tongues Jean de La Rochebrochard Fabrice Bernhard</h1>
