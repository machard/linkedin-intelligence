  <h1>♻️🪙 Circular economy is not always virtuous. Just like Bitcoin, it can trap value at the center.  The idea sounds great reuse, recycle, reinvest. But when the system becomes too closed, the flow of energy, money, or value never reaches the edges. It becomes selfreinforcing. Elitist. Extractive.  Thats why governments keep injecting capital—theyre trying to reach the periphery. But ironically, the more they push, the more the core captures.  Circular systems don’t solve inequality by default. Sometimes, they exacerbate it.  Designing flow matters more than designing loops.</h1>
