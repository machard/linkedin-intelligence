  <h1>Some technologies bind. Others blur.<br /><br />Nicotine and Bitcoin are “circular”: structured, self-reinforcing, precise.<br />They create loops — sometimes brilliant, sometimes brutal.<br /><br />THC and Ethereum are “open”: dissolving lines, exploring edges, revealing paths you didn’t know were there.<br /><br />Both have power. But they shape the mind — and the world — very differently.<br /><br />Sometimes, when the loop gets too tight, what you need isn’t more focus.<br />You need a leak. A drift. A blur.<br />Because keys are often hidden just outside the frame.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#web3 <br />hashtag<br />#psyche <br />hashtag<br />#design <br />hashtag<br />#cognition <br />hashtag<br />#ethereum <br />hashtag<br />#creativity <br />hashtag<br />#attention <br />hashtag<br />#selfsovereignty</h1>
