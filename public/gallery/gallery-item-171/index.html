  <h1>Memetic Inertia The Final Consensus Layer ðŸ§ ðŸªž  Its not about tech. Not about decentralization. Not even money.  Its belief inertia.  A cult of holders bound by past tweets, trapped by influencer hashtags, defending a machine they no longer understand â€”only need.  Statistically, they hold. Philosophically, they fold.  Not because theyâ€™re dumb. But because leaving the meme means losing the mirror.   hashtag #Bitcoin  hashtag #SystemicRecalibration  hashtag #CryptoSatire  hashtag #MemeticInertia</h1>
