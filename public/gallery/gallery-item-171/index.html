  <h1>🚨 Bitcoin Has Peaked The End of an Arc 🚨  After touching $115K in 2025, Bitcoin isn’t crashing — it’s converging.  This isn’t a selloff. It’s a return to baseline.  For 15 years, BTC was an emerging belief structure riding the wave of 🌐 exponential internet adoption 💸 capital liquidity and riskseeking behavior 🧠 increasing fluency in decentralized abstraction  But as of 2025, the coordination substrate has saturated  Over 70% of the global population is online  The narrative has reached peak memetic circulation  Capital is rebalancing toward new primitives (ETH restaking, AItoken hybrids, ecological assets)  BTC didn’t fail. It fulfilled its arc.  Its price action now resembles a decaying wave — not from collapse, but from completion.  Just like MySpace, Napster, or AltaVista, it opened the door — and then stepped aside.  The question isn’t “what’s next for BTC?” It’s “what new signal rises now?”   hashtag #Bitcoin  hashtag #PostPeak  hashtag #CryptoCycles  hashtag #SystemicRecalibration  hashtag #TruthArc  hashtag #MarketNarratives  hashtag #BTC2025</h1>
