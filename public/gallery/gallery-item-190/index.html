  <h1>🔐 Loop 6 “Incentives Solve Everything”  🔁 Loop Explanation This loop emerges from economics, metastasizes in cryptoland, and calcifies into doctrine. At its core is a powerful truth  &gt; If you design the right incentives, good behavior emerges.  It becomes the rallying cry of mechanism design, tokenomics, game theory. But here’s where the loop closes  Every failure is reframed as an incentive misalignment  Every solution becomes a market tweak  Every social layer—trust, culture, context—is dismissed as noise  Over time, humans become utility maximizers, not meaningmakers. Signals become prices, not expressions. Systems become selfjustifying machines, not spaces of value negotiation.  Protocols cease to coordinate people. They coordinate tokens that simulate people.</h1>
