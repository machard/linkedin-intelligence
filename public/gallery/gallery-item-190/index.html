  <h1>The P2P Mind: Consciousness Is a Mesh, Not a Throne<br /><br />We aren’t isolated minds. We are peers in a distributed field of awareness. Thought isn't locked inside our heads—it pulses, refracts, echoes.<br /><br />When I 'think out loud,' I'm not exposing myself. I'm tuning the field. Not broadcasting secrets—but seeding synchrony.<br /><br />Because the mind isn’t a throne you rule from alone— It’s a signal node in a P2P mesh, always already entangled.</h1>
