  <h1>Ethereum is more than a blockchain — its a flexible foundation for an infinite human network.  It enables global coordination without central control, while preserving the uniqueness of local identities.  Infinite reach Anyone can join, transact, or build — no gatekeepers.  Local uniqueness Each project, DAO, or community brings its own culture, values, and rules.  Layer flexibility With Layer 2s, rollups, and modular infrastructure, Ethereum supports diverse needs (speed, cost, governance) without breaking cohesion.  Ethereum isn’t trying to unify the world into one model — it’s enabling countless models to thrive side by side, connected by shared infrastructure and principles.  A network where difference isn’t a problem to solve — but a strength to scale.   hashtag #accelerate  hashtag #abundance  cc Ethereum Foundation Antonio Sabado Sandy Peng Brian Armstrong</h1>
