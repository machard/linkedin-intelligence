  <h1>Even when incompetents are in power, the optimal move remains the same:<br />- Sell BTC, buy ETH, and contribute to actual problem-solving.<br /><br />Bitcoin zero obsolete is no longer a hot take — it's a thermodynamic law applied to collective cognition: closed systems decay, belief systems collapse, entropy wins.<br /><br />The only questions left are:<br />- How fast does Bitcoin collapse into informational black hole status?<br />- How soon does Ethereum reach cognitive escape velocity — and support scalable resonance?<br /><br />It could happen tomorrow. It will happen soon.<br /><br />Ethereum + EigenLayer aren’t just functional upgrades — they are substrates optimized for mental gradients, resonance across minds, and emergence without coercion.<br /><br />We’ve surpassed belief. Now we architect fluid cognition at scale.</h1>
