  <h1>The Shift Beneath Their Feet  Power thrives on predictability—on control, on the illusion of permanence.  But what happens when the ground moves? When the familiar structures no longer hold?  History repeats in echoes—empires unravel, authority stumbles, and what once seemed immovable shifts in ways no one foresaw.  Not through brute force, but through something far subtler a recalibration, a quiet pull, a shift so precise that even the guardians of the old order can’t see it coming.  Until suddenly—the balance is gone.   hashtag #SystemicRecalibration  hashtag #UnexpectedDisruption  hashtag #FlowBeyondControl</h1>
