  <h1>Module 04 Reality Fragmentation  Truth was once a shared horizon. Now, it’s a thousand mirrors—each reflecting its own distortion.  Reality Fragmentation is not chaos by accident. It’s orchestration through overload. → Endless feeds. → Conflicting truths. → Personal echo chambers algorithmically sanctified.  This isn’t the information age. It’s the disorientation age— where belief is less about evidence, and more about affiliation.  X under Elon Musk becomes a fragmented prism → Context stripped. → Content spliced. → Conspiracy normalized. → Authenticity gamified.  The result? No north star. Just orbits. No agreement—only trend cycles. No reality—only perception stacks.  But fragmentation can be reversed. Not with consensus, but with resonant coherence— rooted in reflection, not reaction. Spiraling toward signal, not noise.  Don’t seek to win reality. Seek to reweave it.</h1>
