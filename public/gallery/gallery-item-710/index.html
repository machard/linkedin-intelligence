  <h1>The pandemic didn’t just challenge public health systems — it challenged our relationship to truth itself.<br /><br />One of the most lasting political consequences of Covid is the widespread realization that truth is not absolute. It can be negotiated, shaped, delayed, or framed — depending on who’s speaking, when, and to whom.<br /><br />For many, this was the first time they clearly saw how governments craft narratives. How 'following the science' can mean different things in different countries. How transparency can coexist with opacity. How facts can be selectively highlighted or downplayed to serve policy goals.<br /><br />This isn't about conspiracy — it's about governance. And that realization has quietly changed politics forever.<br /><br />We are entering a post-naïve era:<br /><br />Citizens are more skeptical.<br /><br />Institutions are more fragile.<br /><br />Legitimacy is no longer taken for granted — it must be earned, and re-earned.<br /><br />If politics used to be about managing opinions, it now has to reckon with managing realities. Competing truths. Fragmented trust. And a public that has seen behind the curtain.<br /><br />Are we ready for this new phase?</h1>
