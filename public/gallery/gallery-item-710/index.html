  <h1>Coherence is overrated.<br /><br />We don’t need to be consistent.<br />We need to find the way out of the maze.<br /><br />Politics, identity, strategy — they’re all full of contradictions. Trying to keep everything coherent is exhausting and often futile.<br /><br />What really matters is finding the correct set of actions. The moves that work. The leverage that shifts things. The pivot that opens the next door.<br /><br />In a world obsessed with narratives, some people are just quietly solving the puzzle.<br /><br />They’re not the loudest.<br />They’re not the purest.<br />They’re just the ones who get through.<br /><br />That’s the mindset I’m leaning into.</h1>
