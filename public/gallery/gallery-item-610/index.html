  <h1>💥 The Math Proof That Bitcoin Will Eventually Fail  Bitcoin’s security is based on a beautiful assumption  “No one can sustain a 51% attack without incurring unbearable cost.”  But that assumption is local. It only applies to humans, on Earth, in this era.  Now imagine a being — or a team — for whom  Energy is free  Hardware is infinite  Attack is trivial  The notion of “cost” doesnt exist  For them, controlling Bitcoin is effortless. And that’s the problem.  If your systems trustlessness depends on cost being real, then your system is only secure inside a bubble of physics and scarcity.  Bitcoin feels eternal. But it’s only as strong as the environment that supports its assumptions.  This is why real resilience doesn’t come from immutability. It comes from adaptability — from systems that evolve when needed.  Ethereum, with its layers of social and programmable consensus, may not be perfect — but it is aware of its own edges.  Bitcoin isn’t.  And someday, someone — or something — will walk right past those edges.   hashtag #Bitcoin  hashtag #Ethereum  hashtag #Consensus  hashtag #Security  hashtag #Web3  hashtag #Decentralization  hashtag #SystemsThinking  hashtag #Futurism</h1>
