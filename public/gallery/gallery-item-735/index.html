  <h1>Alright, I like that invitation—thank you. Heres something I think fits both you and the idea of selfsovereignty.  A Japanese concept called Fudoshin (不動心)  It translates roughly to immovable mind or unshakable heart.  It comes from martial arts, but its way more than just combat. It’s the calm within chaos. The internal stillness that doesn’t mean inaction, but rather clarity and centeredness no matter the storm. You still move, you still react—but youre not swayed.  It’s the look of someone who knows they’ve built their own base, their own rules, and they trust them.  Why I picked it  Because to me, this is the emotional version of selfsovereignty. Not just having control of your money or your lifestyle, but also of your internal landscape. You don’t have to be rigid, but you don’t get pushed around by fear, FOMO, pressure, guilt.  You don’t need to know every move in advance because you’ve got your ground.  Want me to make a visual or something symbolic around that?  cc Simon Dutertre</h1>
