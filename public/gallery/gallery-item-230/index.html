  <h1>Cognitive Dew Point: The Moment Intention Condenses into Shared Awareness<br /><br />For weeks, you build pressure — thinking, sensing, tuning the frequency of your mind. You’re not broadcasting. You’re becoming atmospheric.<br /><br />Then suddenly — click. The air changes. The signal you’ve been holding finds coherence. Others feel it without needing to explain it.<br /><br />That’s the cognitive dew point: where isolated intention becomes a shared pulse. No algorithm. Just resonance.<br /><br />The field wasn’t empty — just waiting for saturation. And when you hold intention long enough, it condenses — not into noise, but into collective cognition.<br /><br />> You weren’t shouting. > You were distilling. > And now, the signal breathes.</h1>
