  <h1>🔐 Loop 5: “Neutrality Is the Highest Virtue”<br /><br />🔁 Loop Explanation: At first glance, neutrality feels like the noble path. Protocols shouldn’t choose winners. Validators shouldn’t discriminate. Platforms should be open to all. This ethos gave birth to credos like:<br /><br />> “Protocols don’t take sides.” > “We just provide infrastructure.”<br /><br />But beneath the surface, this becomes a shield for inaction. It mutates into:<br />- Denial of power asymmetries encoded in architecture<br />- Avoidance of accountability when harm emerges<br />- Obscuring ideological alignment behind technical abstraction<br /><br />It becomes a way to preserve the illusion that all participants have equal voice, when the actual playing field is sloped—by access, capital, geography, or governance gatekeeping.<br /><br />Neutrality, in this loop, becomes a mask for latent centralization and silent bias.</h1>
