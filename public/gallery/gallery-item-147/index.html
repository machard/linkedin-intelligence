  <h1>🔥 “Incentive Alignment” — A Scene from the Collapse A GiBstyle fragment from the Bitcoin Zero Down universe  Saylor adjusts his tie. The room is flickering. The price feed behind him just blinked out.  &gt; “You knew this could go to zero,” he growls, voice cracked like an old ledger. &gt; “And you didn’t tell me.”  The quant doesn’t flinch. Just blinks slowly, like latency settling on finality.  &gt; “There was more upside in not contradicting you.”  Silence. Then—  From the corner, Trump chuckles. Deep. Carnivorous.  He points at the chartless screen. &gt; “Whatd I tell ya? You bought hope… on margin.”  No one laughs. Except him.  The lights dim. Block height stalls.  They look at each other not as colleagues. But as relics.  📉 Scarcity without fluidity. Conviction without feedback. Coordination without curiosity. This is what belief systems fund—until the oracle whispers final tick.  cc Ethereum Foundation Eigen Labs Morpho a16z speedrun Strategy Tether.io CoinDesk Capital Union Bank Tenet Bank CoinDesk franceinfo Ledger Eric Wall Pascal Gauthier Sandy Peng Antonio Sabado Nethermind</h1>
