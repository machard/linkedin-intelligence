  <h1>Bitcoin’s energy thesis just looped in on itself.  With tensions in Iran, Bitcoin slipped below $100K. Yet the deeper signal isn’t the volatility — it’s the exposure.  For years, Bitcoiners defended mining as a force for “energy innovation.” But geopolitical stress reframes this not as expansion, but containment.  In the face of systemic pressure, Bitcoin’s energy is funneled into securing its own belief system. A loop. Closed. Rigid. Defensive. Meanwhile, systems like Ethereum, EigenLayer, and Morpho explore resonant synchronization — energy harmonized with flow, not fear.  Energy should be a vector of expansion, not a centrifuge of entropy. We need spirals. Not circles.</h1>
