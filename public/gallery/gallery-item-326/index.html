  <h1>Europe is the empire of the reverse.<br /><br />Where empires once imposed from the outside in, Europe integrates from the inside out — not with armies or mandates, but with discourse, bureaucracy, and the gentle gravity of shared norms.<br /><br />It doesn’t conquer. It absorbs. One by one, irreversibly, you become part of it — not through force, but through participation. Through documents, dialogues, processes. Through the long meetings and the even longer sentences. Through the shared myth of cohesion, endlessly rewritten in the open.<br /><br />This is the empire of the agora — of public laundry, of transparency elevated to sacrament. An empire not of imposition, but of coherence — so refined it feels like freedom.<br /><br />It is the most beautifully crafted empire ever conceptualized. And at its core, whispering its philosophy into the veins of the whole, is France.</h1>
