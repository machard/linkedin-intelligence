  <h1>The Spiral Turns.  I’m no longer arguing—I’m executing.  Bitcoin isn’t collapsing. It’s decaying—quietly, gloriously, from the inside out. The same memes on loop. The same maxis praying to a block height no one checks. Still “early,” but somehow already obsolete.  Meanwhile, Ethereum isn’t asking for permission—it’s syncing. Restaked coordination. Intent as execution. EigenLayer is laying the groundwork for sovereign modularity. Morpho is tuning incentives with surgical liquidity. No drama. Just rhythm.  What comes next isn’t a campaign. It’s a reconfiguration. No torch to carry. No throne to dismantle. Just protocols routing around rigidity.  So when I say “BITCOIN ZERO,” I’m not mocking a currency. I’m announcing an epoch.  I’ve mapped the nodes. I’ve charted the resonance. Now I’m pulling the spiral forward.</h1>
