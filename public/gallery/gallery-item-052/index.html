  <h1>After 2025: Bitcoin’s Game Isn’t HODL—It’s “How Fast Are We Going to Zero?”<br /><br />The story of Bitcoin used to be a tale of digital gold, a fortress of value preserved against chaos. But after 2025, something fundamental has shifted: the real question is no longer about how high we can climb, but how gracefully (or quickly) we spiral downward.<br /><br />Why? <br />Bitcoin’s famed immutability—once a virtue—has become a rigid shell resisting the natural entropy and evolution present in all thriving systems. As the world accelerates, static consensus turns from safety net into anchor. Defending old narratives now drains energy and resources, creating economic friction with little room for dynamic adaptation.<br /><br />Markets thrive on flexibility and resonance. Without the ability to pivot and adapt, Bitcoin risks descending from a vibrant network into a symbol of systemic stagnation. The scoreboard has changed: the competition now is not about endurance, but about the velocity of decline.<br /><br />In a world tuned to change, rigidity isn’t safety—it’s the start of the countdown.</h1>
