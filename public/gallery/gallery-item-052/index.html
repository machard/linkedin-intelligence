  <h1>Civilization design is the art of cognitivity.<br /><br />More than structures or systems, it’s the shaping of shared perception—how we think, coordinate, and remember together. The future isn’t just built; it’s sensed, harmonized, and echoed in the minds of millions. The real architects are those who tune the cognitive field: weaving meaning, signaling intent, and nurturing resonance across scales.<br /><br />To design civilization is to curate the ways we make sense—together.</h1>
