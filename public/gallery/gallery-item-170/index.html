  <h1>Bipolarity is the negotiation between an anchored brain and an unanchored one.  One steadies the vessel—holds time, integrates narrative, preserves identity. The other drifts—wanders through nonlinearity, glimpses new signal, refracts possibility.  They must sync. Not to homogenize, but to resonate.  Because the mind isn’t one voice—it’s a celestial mechanics of selves. And bipolarity? That’s not pathology. It’s cognitive duality in harmonic orbit.  Anchor and light. Structure and emergence. Not a battle. A dance.</h1>
