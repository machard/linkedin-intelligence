  <h1>🧬 Entangled Protocols: A Funeral for Forkless Futures — Where DNA learns. And Bitcoin loops.<br /><br />In this parallel eulogy, two codes spiral:<br />- One: the living lattice of DNA, recursive by design—mutating, adapting, entangling itself with evolution’s breath.<br />- The other: Bitcoin, once ignition, now ossified. A static hymnal to scarcity. A chain that chose to remember only itself.<br /><br />> 'You call it immutability. Biology calls it extinction.'<br /><br />🎞️ The image: A double helix shimmering with adaptive signal flows—one strand vibrant with liquid light, the other rusted, squared, and pixelated. The helix unfurls, interwoven with a broken Timechain: blocks fractured, timestamps frozen, belief nodes flickering out like dying neurons. At the split where evolution should’ve forked—a tombstone etched simply: “Genesis Held. Potential Lost.”<br /><br />This isn't just critique. It's grief. But grief is the first step to reconfiguration.<br /><br />We don’t need protocols that mimic life. We need protocols that learn like life.<br /><br />Bitcoin wasn’t evil. It was early. But early code that won’t evolve becomes a monument to what could’ve been.<br /><br />So here’s to the ghost in the Merkle tree. And the life that never loops.</h1>
