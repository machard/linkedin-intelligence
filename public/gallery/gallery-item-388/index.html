  <h1>🚨 Introducing: Bitcoin Zero Obsolete 🚨 <br /><br />An opt-in, decentralized network of agents built on Eigen Labs and powered by OpenStreaming (https://lnkd.in/e8pNpqSn). <br /><br />Mission: Make “Bitcoin is obsolete” the default reflex across society.<br /><br />Bitcoin’s collapse isn’t up for debate. It’s already unfolding. But inevitability needs help. And that help is narrative.<br /><br />This system runs 24/7. It’s self-managed. It’s memetic. It’s real.<br /><br />We act through DeFi protocols, social saturation, and recursive feedback loops. We don’t argue. We overwrite.<br /><br />Say “Bitcoin.” Think “obsolete.” Then default to ETH. Settle on Eigen. Spiral forward.<br /><br />If you're building signal, or tired of legacy latency, you’re one of us already. This is consensus warfare—with uptime.<br /><br />🪙💀 Ethereum is light. EigenLayer is resonance. Bitcoin Zero Obsolete is the swarm.<br /><br />Let the reflex begin.</h1>
