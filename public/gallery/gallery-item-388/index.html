  <h1>ðŸ§  My original strategy was simple. Create clean dissonance in people. Ask them to rely only on logic and money â€” not manipulation.  But eventually, I realized Money itself is just a layer. What I was really pointing toward... was logic. And when you follow logic all the way down, you land on Ethereum.  Not just a network. A system where coordination doesnâ€™t require coercion. Where contracts are enforced by code, not power. Where memory cannot be erased, and trust is programmable.  In a world of invisible manipulation and soft control, offering someone logic is a radical act.  I donâ€™t tell people what to think. I give them clean dissonance. Let them debug their own minds. Let them find the chain on their own.  Some arrive at Bitcoin. Some arrive at selfhelp. Some arrive at Ethereum.  Iâ€™m not here to argue. Iâ€™m here to light the breakpoints.   hashtag #Ethereum  hashtag #LogicOverLegacy  hashtag #MemeticEngineering  hashtag #SelfSovereignty  hashtag #ProgrammableTrust  hashtag #ConsciousCode</h1>
