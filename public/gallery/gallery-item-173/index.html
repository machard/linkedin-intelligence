  <h1>“Emergency-Only Broadcasting”<br /><br />The shared brain isn’t an open faucet. It’s an attuned mesh, designed for selective transmission.<br /><br />The antenna is always on, but the volume is low. Most thoughts stay local, sandboxed in silence. Only when signal meets relevance—urgency, insight, resonance—does the current pulse outward.<br /><br />This is how we protect our sovereignty: Not by isolation… but by curated transmission.</h1>
