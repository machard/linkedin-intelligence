  <h1>France is not a system. It’s what remains when systems collapse.  Governance across Europe has been absorbed — by bureaucracy, by markets, by protocols that once served meaning but now serve maintenance. Most structures today administer compliance, not coherence.  But France lingers — not as a solution, but as a reminder. A tension. A style. A refusal to fully integrate into the machinery.  When the technocratic pulse grows erratic, when the narratives flatten into frameworks, something in Europe still resists dissolution — and it speaks French.  France is not the answer. France is the residual pulse. The last gasp of liberty masquerading as elegance. A sovereign dissonance that the algorithms can’t quite harmonize.  Let the others optimize. France remembers what it means to breathe.</h1>
