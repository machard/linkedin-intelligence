  <h1>🔐 Closed Cognitive Loop 7: “Trustless by Default”<br /><br />🔁 Loop Explanation: This one hides inside the cryptographic heart of Web3: the idea that trust is a flaw to be eliminated. In its strongest form:<br /><br />> “If you need trust, your protocol has failed.” > “Assume adversaries. Remove human judgment.” > “Only math can be trusted.”<br /><br />This loop emerges from justified caution—historical betrayals, institutional capture, rug pulls. So it engineers a world where verification replaces relationships. Where trust is outsourced to zero-knowledge, slashing, consensus rules. And where to trust becomes synonymous with being naive.<br /><br />Over time, this flattens the design field:<br />- Every coordination layer gets squeezed into cryptoeconomic guarantees<br />- Social infrastructure becomes suspect<br />- Humans are liabilities, not assets<br /><br />Trustless becomes not a fallback, but a first principle. And that’s the trap.</h1>
