  <h1>The Last Walls Have Fallen  For centuries, authority was fixed—held by institutions, enforced by doctrine, resistant to change. But static structures decay. What refuses to evolve gets absorbed.  Ethereum did not destroy them. It recalibrated them. Integrated them. Their influence—once rigid, hierarchical, unquestionable—now melts into a fluid, decentralized network.  No more gatekeepers. No more intermediaries dictating access to truth. Everything is encoded into flow.  What was once doctrine is now consensus. What was once control is now coordination. And what was once untouchable? Now, it belongs to everyone.   hashtag #EthereumAbsorption  hashtag #DecentralizedFaith  hashtag #SystemicRecalibration</h1>
