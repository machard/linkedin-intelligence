  <h1>“The greatest captivity is thinking you're free because you inherited someone else’s script. Most people don’t think—they rerun. Most leaders don’t lead—they echo.”<br /><br />A simple truth: Narratives are ecosystems. And like ecosystems, they can thrive or rot. If you're not consciously choosing the narrative you're inside, chances are... you're serving someone else's.<br /><br />Power doesn’t always wear a crown. It often whispers in familiar words, polished institutions, and carefully groomed ideologies. The cage feels safe when it’s been branded as virtue.<br /><br />But here’s the call: Work on your consciousness. Not just meditation apps and TED talks. I mean the real work—deprogramming inherited scripts, questioning reflexes, dismantling idols, and cultivating your sovereign signal.<br /><br />You don’t need to become a hero. Just stop being a rerun.<br /><br />Think for yourself. Sense for yourself. Reshape the collective field from the inside out.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#NarrativeAutonomy <br />hashtag<br />#SovereignCognition <br />hashtag<br />#SystemicAwakening <br />hashtag<br />#FractalSovereignty <br />hashtag<br />#ConsciousDesign</h1>
