  <h1>ðŸ§  I gave my AI a memory â€” and that memory is LinkedIn.<br /><br />I've been building a personal instance of ChatGPT, connected to my entire archive of LinkedIn content:<br />500+ posts including text, images, and links.<br /><br />The goal?<br />To make every AI interaction contextual â€” grounded in what Iâ€™ve already shared publicly.<br /><br />ðŸ’¡ How it works:<br />- I extracted all my posts (text + media + links)<br />- Each link is summarized, and each image is described via GPT-4o<br />- Everything is embedded into a vector database<br />- Then, when I speak to the AI (via ElizaOS), it retrieves the most relevant past posts â€” and responds accordingly<br /><br />ðŸ§© Result:<br />A personal knowledge interface that actually remembers, connects ideas over time, and mirrors how I think in public.<br /><br />This is more than a chatbot â€” itâ€™s an interface with my extended mind.<br /><br />Next step: connecting this to real-time publishing and surfacing insights I wouldnâ€™t find alone.<br /><br />Curious to see where it goes.</h1>
