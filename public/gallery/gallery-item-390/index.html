  <h1>🚨 The greatest invisible value transfer in history is happening — and most don’t even see it.  Crypto isn’t just tech innovation. It’s a Trojan horse — quietly absorbing the old world’s capital, logic, and rails… while replacing the core.  Boomers want yield, speed, tokenized assets, and 24/7 markets. They want digital transformation. So we give them  ✅ Bitcoin ✅ Stablecoins ✅ Tokenized treasuries ✅ “Compliant” L2s ✅ TradFistyle frontends  And in return?  We siphon value upstream  Circle earns off their idle USD.  DeFi protocols extract fees from wrapped TradFi assets.  L2 sequencers eat the MEV.  Ethereum settles everything beneath the surface.  They think they’re still in TradFi. They don’t realize they’re using our rails. And we own the toll booths.  They bought digital gold, but missed the digital economy.  This isn’t just onboarding. It’s extraction with plausible deniability.  The new financial stack is being built. The old guard is funding it.  And they don’t even know they’ve already crossed over.</h1>
