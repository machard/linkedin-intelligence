  <h1>Web3 Builders It’s Time to Act with Integrity  The promise of web3 is about decentralization, trust, and empowerment—not deception. Yet, too often the ecosystem is clouded by behavior and messaging that echo the very systems we set out to disrupt.   Let’s move beyond sarcasm and empty hype. Authentic innovation means building transparently, communicating honestly, and rejecting shortcuts that undermine community trust.   We don’t need to mimic the tactics of scam projects to be seen or succeed. When our actions align with our stated values, web3 grows stronger and more resilient.  Drop the act. Lead with clarity, not contradiction. The future is watching.</h1>
