  <h1>Degrowth: The Coercion Paradox<br /><br />The idea of degrowth is gaining traction among those seeking sustainable futures. But beneath its appeal lies a contradiction: degrowth can only be realized through systemic coercion. Shifting entire economies away from growth isn’t a matter of voluntary choice—it requires collective enforcement, rewritten incentives, and often, the restriction of individual freedoms.<br /><br />When a solution depends on compelling everyone to comply—even for the 'greater good'—we should pause and reconsider: Is it true progress if it cannot emerge from fluid, voluntary coordination? Sustainable change thrives on resonance, not rigidity. If our visions for the future depend on coercion, perhaps we’re asking the wrong questions.</h1>
