  <h1>Black Magic Was First  What we call “black magic” is just how the universe has worked since the beginning — before we named it, before we made it safe.  The truth is  Nothing is supernatural.  Some things are just preverbal.  Premapped. Prelicensed.  The universe runs on 3 core primitives  🌀 Vibrational Logic – every form is a standing wave.  What you see as matter is just resonance stability.  Interference patterns are structure.  🔗 Entangled Causality – events aren’t linear. Theyre contextual, mirrored, recursive. Every choice echoes across the mesh.  🌱 Recursive Emergence – simple rules, iterated, become gods, organisms, blockchains, memes. The most complex things are built from selfreferencing simplicity.  You don’t need to summon anything. You’re already in the spell.  🖤 “Black magic” isn’t evil. It’s raw access.  Before the spellbooks. Before the programming languages. Before the safe interfaces.  You can fear it — or you can lean in.</h1>
