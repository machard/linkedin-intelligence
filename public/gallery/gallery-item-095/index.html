  <h1>ðŸ”¹ What is a 'Rug' in Bitcoin?<br /><br />In the Bitcoin world, a 'rug' (short for 'rug pull') describes a situation where a project or system suddenly collapses, leaving supporters and investors stranded. It typically means those controlling the systemâ€”be it a team, influencer, or unchecked protocolâ€”abandon their commitments or intentionally drain value, causing those who believed in the project to lose trust and often resources.<br /><br />The term echoes the image of someone pulling a rug out from under you: unexpected, destabilizing, and leaving you off-balance. In Bitcoinâ€™s case, an ecosystem that promises immutability or safety can still experience 'rugs' when underlying narratives, community trust, or market structures break down.</h1>
