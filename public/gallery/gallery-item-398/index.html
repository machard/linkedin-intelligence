  <h1>ðŸ“¸ The collapse of institutions is not a bug â€” itâ€™s the upload process.  The bank will eventually go onchain.  Its current moat is its control over meatspace client flow â€” onboarding, compliance, fiat access.  But once that flow becomes onchain, the flow becomes free. Autonomous. Programmable.  Onchain, there is no lockin. Switching is instant. Movement is native. What used to be hard becomes trivial. What used to be guarded becomes permissionless.  Slowly, piece by piece, society as we know it is being decomposed into primitive, composable, and trustless flows onchain.  Identity â†’ onchain reputation and attestations Credit â†’ decentralized, social, and algorithmic Custody â†’ smart contracts, not custodians Compliance â†’ realtime transparency, not opaque reporting Governance â†’ programmable consensus, not legacy structures  The institutions we rely on today will either become protocols, serve protocols â€” or fade.  This isnâ€™t just about technology. Itâ€™s a fundamental shift in how value, coordination, and trust operate.  From institutions â†’ to flows. From intermediaries â†’ to autonomy. From control â†’ to composability.  Its already happening.</h1>
