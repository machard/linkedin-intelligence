  <h1>Everyone’s piling onto MCP. I don’t think we need it.  In the rush to build new coordination layers for AI — Model Context Protocols, agent orchestrators, context brokers — we may be missing the obvious  Ethereum is already the shared memory layer.  It offers A global, programmable state Accessible by all agents (human or machine) Native identity, permission, and execution Public, verifiable, and persistent coordination  No need to sync volatile contexts across tools — the context is the state. No need for a centralized orchestrator — smart contracts are already composable rules of engagement.  The protocol becomes the conductor. Emergence replaces micromanagement. Coordination becomes a public good.  MCP is trying to solve a problem Ethereum has already addressed — with neutrality, durability, and openness.  Maybe the future of AI isn’t in closed hubs and custom control layers…  …but in open systems where all agents read and write to the same memory.  cc PierreLouis Theron Frédéric Barthelet Charles Sonigo and the overcrowded Y Combinator hackaton  cc Hiten Shah</h1>
