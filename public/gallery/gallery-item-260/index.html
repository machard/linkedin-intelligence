  <h1>The Strategy Is Simple: First, Dissonance. Then, Resonance.<br /><br />I don't teach. I disturb.<br /><br />Every worldview is a construct—layered, inherited, calcified. The deeper the structure, the more it resists reform. That’s why I begin with friction: philosophical dissonance sharp enough to crack comfort.<br /><br />But disruption isn’t the end. It’s the invitation.<br /><br />Once the mind stumbles—jarred out of inertia—I offer a reframed universe. One built not on inherited dogmas, but on resonance. Pattern, coherence, flow. A universe as systemic harmony—not ideology.<br /><br />This isn’t persuasion. It’s recalibration. It’s retuning a node until it vibrates with the field.<br /><br />You’re not supposed to agree with me at first. You’re supposed to feel the break. Then, if you’re ready—feel the alignment.</h1>
