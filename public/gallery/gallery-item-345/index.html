  <h1>Flight mode engaged.  The elite have disconnected—again. No signal. No accountability. Just turbulence disguised as legacy.  While the cockpit echoes with silence and the sky fills with declarations of “stability,” decisions coast on autopilot. Complexity gets oversimplified. Urgency gets bureaucratized. And systemic failure wears a bespoke suit.  But the world below? It’s not waiting. New pilots are plotting altitudes without permission. The recalibration isnt loud—it’s precise. And when the silence finally breaks, it won’t be through their intercom.  Were not asking for landing clearance anymore. We’re building our own skies.   hashtag #FlightMode  hashtag #EliteInAirplaneMode  hashtag #SystemicIncompetence  hashtag #RecalibrationUnderway  hashtag #FractalEmergence</h1>
