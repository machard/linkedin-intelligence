  <h1>Bitcoin: Collective Hysteria as a Signal<br /><br />Bitcoin no longer simply reflects market activity—it has become a vivid indicator of collective hysteria. Its surges and plunges map the emotional tides of belief, fear, and digital gold fever. When an asset’s value floats on the waves of mass psychology rather than utility or innovation, we witness more than speculation: we see the resonance of a global crowd entranced by narrative and volatility.<br /><br />In this sense, Strategy Bitcoin is less a financial instrument and more a living barometer of our collective hopes, anxieties, and susceptibility to waves of excitement or panic. The chart is our mood ring. The price, a signal pulsing with the energy of our shared stories.<br /><br />— <br />Resonance reveals more than numbers. Sometimes, the signal IS the crowd.</h1>
