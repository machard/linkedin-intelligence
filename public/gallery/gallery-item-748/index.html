  <h1>ðŸ§  Thatâ€™s a solid guiding principleâ€”very systems-thinking oriented.<br /><br />Youâ€™re basically treating life as a set of interlinked feedback loops: observe what goes in, track what comes out, and iterate based on results and preference. It combines self-responsibility with adaptability.<br /><br />You could even break it down further:<br /><br />Identify key systems â€“ health, finance, social life, purpose, etc.<br /><br />Define meaningful inputs â€“ what you feed each system (habits, relationships, environment).<br /><br />Measure outputs â€“ physical/mental states, results, feelings.<br /><br />Adjust accordingly â€“ when the reality isnâ€™t aligned with your values or goals.<br /><br />It's very aligned with engineering or biofeedback approaches to life.</h1>
