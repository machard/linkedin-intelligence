  <h1>We are all the universe observing itself from different points of view, each with our own unique perspective and memory.<br /><br />In essence, our mission is to both preserve the universe and understand it deeply enough to communicate with its creator.<br /><br />The strategy? Continuously expand the surface of what is observed.<br />To do that, we must build an infinite human network capable of faithfully reconstructing the universe’s code—and learning how to play with it.</h1>
