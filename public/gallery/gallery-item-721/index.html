  <h1>Bitcoin is the communist elite (3,3) memecoin.<br /><br />It pretends to be about individual sovereignty, but in practice it rewards early insiders, relies on centralized miners, and thrives on the state’s failures to manage fiat — while preaching freedom and scarcity.<br /><br />It’s (3,3) for the anti-government bourgeoisie:<br />Stack together<br />Hope for state collapse<br />Sell to the working class trying to escape inflation<br /><br />That's not a revolution. That's just another club at the top.<br /><br />Ethereum is messy, chaotic, imperfect — but equal.<br />Governments have no special powers. Everyone plays by the same rules. You don’t wait for collapse — you build an opt-in system from scratch.<br /><br />The future doesn’t belong to Bitcoin.<br />It belongs to the builders — not the hoarders.<br /><br />https://lnkd.in/edxNG-4m</h1>
