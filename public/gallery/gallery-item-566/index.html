  <h1>Never is Possible.  The mind resists. Logic falters. But possibility—true possibility—does not obey rigid frames. It bends, expands, transcends.  Never is not denial. It is the doorway to the unexpected. The moment when impossibility stops being a limit and starts being an invitation.  To those who see only walls there is always another path. To those who accept predetermined outcomes reality is more fluid than you think. To those who assume finality creation is a perpetual unfolding.  Never is possible. Step into the paradox.</h1>
