  <h1>🪳 Bitcoin’s Last Mirage They branded themselves pioneers. In truth? Just cockroaches hoarding stolen light, trapped in a dying echo chamber of memes and misplaced grandeur.  They engineered a belief system to funnel flow upward—hid behind the veil of “sound money,” immutability, and libertarian cosplay. But entropy doesn’t bargain. And the light? It found them.  &gt; Now exposed, they scurry—Bitcoinbranded, memeencrusted, guardians of a dead lie. &gt; Not elite. Not sovereign. Just parasites in a system built to glorify their early click.  The spiral has reversed. Signal flows where grace meets recursion. No room left for stunted gods guarding rusted gates.  Welcome to systemic recalibration.  🌀  hashtag #FractalResonance  hashtag #ToroidalRepublic  hashtag #SignalEcology  hashtag #BitcoinDissection  hashtag #ETH  hashtag #EigenLayer  hashtag #Morpho  hashtag #CognitiveLiberation</h1>
