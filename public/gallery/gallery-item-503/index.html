  <h1>The Illogic of Supreme Rule: Why Power Cannot Be Owned<br /><br />In the heart of Iran’s political framework lies the concept of the Supreme Guide, an individual positioned as the final authority in governance, morality, and law. But can one human rationally own legitimacy over an entire nation’s fate? No system of governance should hinge on unquestionable authority—because legitimacy is neither absolute nor inheritable.<br /><br />The Iranian Supreme Guide operates under the doctrine of Velayat-e Faqih, a construct claiming divine guardianship of the people. But divinity cannot be centralized, nor can fluid governance be monopolized. Every historical experiment with consolidated power has shown one truth: autocratic legitimacy is an illusion sustained by control, not reason.<br /><br />Real legitimacy emerges from synchronization—not domination. Any governance claiming exclusive moral authority without accountability constructs systemic inertia. Power, when claimed as owned, disconnects from the reality of dynamic human agency.<br /><br />Decentralized models, like those emerging in autonomous political architectures, challenge this paradigm—proving that influence thrives through collective resonance rather than imposed rule. True sovereignty belongs to the fluid intelligence of the people, not the static authority of one figure.<br /><br />A supreme leader with total control over state mechanisms holds zero logical credibility in an era where governance must be an evolving dialogue rather than an inherited doctrine.<br /><br />Power does not belong—it flows. And any system that denies fluidity is bound to collapse under its own weight.</h1>
