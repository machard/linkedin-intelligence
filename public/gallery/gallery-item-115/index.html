  <h1>🔐 Loop 4 “Code Is Law” → “Law Is Dead”  🔁 Loop Explanation This loop begins as a pragmatic insight and calcifies into dogma. The phrase “Code is Law” was born from a desire for predictability, neutrality, and immutability. Smart contracts don’t lie. They execute. In a world riddled with legal ambiguity and human corruption, this seems like salvation.  But in Bitcoin and similar cultures, it mutates &gt; If the protocol enforces it, it must be right. &gt; If humans override it, we’re back to tyranny. &gt; Therefore, law—as deliberation, adaptation, and interpretation—is suspect.  This loop fetishizes determinism. It equates enforcement with justice, and conflates technical certainty with moral clarity. Over time, it drains legitimacy from all extraprotocol governance. If it’s not enforced by code, it’s noise.  So we spiral into a world where intent, context, and nuance are seen as weaknesses.</h1>
