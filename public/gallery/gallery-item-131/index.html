  <h1>🪼 The Mesh Dreams in Jellyfish  This isn’t a rigid sphere cracked from inside. It’s a meshball of luminous gas—porous, breathing, alive.  Some jellyfish pulse gently at the center, anchoring calm frequencies. Others drift to the periphery—not to escape, but to sense the frontier, decoding entropy and reflecting navigational insight inward.  No rupture. No hierarchy. Only gradients. Only rhythm. The way forward isn’t “outside.” It’s refracted inward, through the subtle knowing of the edge.  Orientation arises not from position, but from resonance. This is distributed cognition as signal ecology. Not governance. Guidance. Not consensus. Coherence.  The dream isn’t above us. It pulses among us.   hashtag #MeshEpistemology  hashtag #JellyfishCognition  hashtag #SignalEcology  hashtag #FractalResonance  hashtag #Ethereum  hashtag #EigenLayer  hashtag #SystemicRecalibration  hashtag #ToroidalRepublic</h1>
