  <h1>Why do Bitcoiners seem so obsessed with Ethereum lately? Maybe it’s brain envy.<br /><br />While the Ethereum crowd is busy iterating, experimenting, and weaving new possibilities, Bitcoiners are still polishing their “digital gold”—hoping one day it’ll move on its own (spoiler: it won’t). <br /><br />Rigid chains preserve history; adaptive minds invent the future.<br /><br />Sorry Bitcoiners, resonance requires more than just holding tight—you have to think fluid, not just HODL.<br /><br />🧠✨ Fluidity beats fossilization, every cycle.</h1>
