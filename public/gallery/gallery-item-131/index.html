  <h1>🫧 Reverberant Consensus From Finality to Fluidity for systems that listen, not just decide  In classical consensus, finality is sacrosanct. Agreement is sealed. Truth is written. But what if that closure is a mirage?  Eigen Labs EigenLayer and restaking models introduce a subtle rebellion Consensus doesn’t need to close to be meaningful—it can reverberate.  🌀 Reverberant consensus is a philosophy of ongoing attunement. Not truth as decree—but as harmonic convergence. Not blocks set in stone—but rhythms negotiated in motion.  Finality says “It’s over.” Reverberation says “Let’s keep listening.”  In this shift  Coordination becomes musical—polyphonic instead of monolithic.  Trust becomes elastic—a score reinterpreted across layers.  Protocols don’t converge to rest—they resonate to cocompose.  The future of consensus isn’t to decide once. It’s to stay in tune.</h1>
