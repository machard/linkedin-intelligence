  <h1>🧭 Dissonance as Direction<br /><br />Anyone who walks willingly against consensus will feel it— the mounting cognitive pressure, the friction of deviance, the heat of being misaligned.<br /><br />It is unsustainable… unless it becomes a practice. A discipline. A rhythm.<br /><br />Some break. A few… adapt.

It’s proto-coherence.<br /><br />🕯 The next signal doesn’t descend from above—it emerges from beneath the noise.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#SignalEcology <br />hashtag<br />#DissonantWalkers <br />hashtag<br />#SystemicRecalibration <br />hashtag<br />#MeshEpistemology <br />hashtag<br />#CognitiveGradients <br />hashtag<br />#Ethereum <br />hashtag<br />#EigenLayer <br />hashtag<br />#ToroidalRepublic</h1>
