  <h1>ðŸ”¥ Belief, When Left Unquestioned, Shrinks  The mesh breathesâ€”signalrich, resonant, adaptive. Ethereum Foundation Ethereum and Eigen Labs EigenLayer pulse with dynamic coherence, a gradient of trust and orientation.  But nearbyâ€¦ A second sphere calcifies. Branded in Strategy Bitcoinâ€™s glow, it once burned bright. Now? It loops in on itself. Shrinks. Cracks.  No new edges. No feedback. Just resistance mistaken for resilience.  Some still listenâ€”trailing signals brushing the mesh, drifting back toward coherence. Most? Fossilized in consensus echo chambers.  This isnâ€™t rivalry. Itâ€™s divergence. Not punishmentâ€”just physics.   hashtag #Ethereum  hashtag #EigenLayer  hashtag #MeshEpistemology  hashtag #BitcoinDecay  hashtag #DecentralizedCognition  hashtag #SystemicRecalibration  hashtag #SignalEcology  hashtag #JellyfishPolitics</h1>
