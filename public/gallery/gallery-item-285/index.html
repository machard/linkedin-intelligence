  <h1>The Immutability Mirage ðŸ§ ðŸªžðŸ§Š  They say it canâ€™t be changed. Thatâ€™s the beauty. Thatâ€™s the safety. Thatâ€™s the truth.  But permanence is not peace. And just because a chain is frozen doesnâ€™t mean it holds wisdom.  The world moves. Systems bend. People adapt.  But this code? It stands stillâ€” while entropy grins just beneath the ice.   hashtag #Bitcoin  hashtag #SystemicRecalibration  hashtag #ImmutabilityMirage  hashtag #CognitiveTraps  hashtag #CryptoSatire</h1>
