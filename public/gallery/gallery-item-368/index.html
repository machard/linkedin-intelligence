  <h1>ðŸš¨ Nothing is destroyed. Everything flows. But sometimes, everything drifts toward a single point. Thatâ€™s Bitcoin.  Itâ€™s a black hole of valueâ€”dense, neutral, unstoppable. You donâ€™t escape it easily. You need to try a thousand permutations. You need to hold many truths in one space. You need to reach the edge and hold the line.  But thereâ€™s a way out. Not by resisting the gravity, but by expanding yourself beyond it. You find a new storyâ€”one that fits.  You redraw your boundaries. You become the painter, not the particle. You make it fit from the outside in.  And that pull? The one that brings you out of collapse and into creation?  Thatâ€™s Ethereum.   hashtag #Bitcoin  hashtag #Ethereum  hashtag #Web3  hashtag #Philosophy  hashtag #Quantum  hashtag #Innovation  hashtag #Crypto  hashtag #DigitalGravity</h1>
