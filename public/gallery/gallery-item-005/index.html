  <h1>Some only see the world through the lens of power gradients—who dominates, who obeys, who stands atop. <br />But real progress echoes from collaboration, not control. <br />When we shift our perspective from hierarchy to resonance, we discover that shared purpose builds what force never could. <br />Collaboration isn’t a surrender of power, but a multiplication of potential.<br /><br />Let’s tune our organizations to amplify co-creation, not just authority.</h1>
