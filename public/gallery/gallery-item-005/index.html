  <h1>🤡✨ BBC — Big Bitcoin Clown — is on his knees again today.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because the Great Meme Lord tweeted: “Fiat is worthless.”<br /><br />Now every Bitcoiner is a priest — eyes rolled back, chanting “We were right! We were right!” — as if one tweet could fix a frozen protocol.<br /><br />👉 No new governance.<br />👉 No better coordination.<br />👉 No real evolution.<br /><br />Just the same old echo chamber — praying for a pump.<br /><br />Fiat might be worthless.<br />Blind belief is too.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#Bitcoin <br />hashtag<br />#Musk <br />hashtag<br />#BBC <br />hashtag<br />#BigBitcoinClown <br />hashtag<br />#Satire</h1>
