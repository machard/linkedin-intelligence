  <h1>Some only see the world through the lens of power gradients—who dominates, who obeys, who stands atop.  But real progress echoes from collaboration, not control.  When we shift our perspective from hierarchy to resonance, we discover that shared purpose builds what force never could.  Collaboration isn’t a surrender of power, but a multiplication of potential.  Let’s tune our organizations to amplify cocreation, not just authority.</h1>
