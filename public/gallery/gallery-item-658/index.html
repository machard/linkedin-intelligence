  <h1>Some people read math. Others see it.  Same with music.  One person sees a formula — another sees a curve bending through space. One reads notes — the other hears a shape unfolding in time.  When you see structure, not just symbols, you can  – Understand it  – Rebuild it  – Break it and make it better  You’re not decoding anymore. You’re in conversation with the pattern.  That’s when fluency begins → In math, you can rederive what you forget. → In music, you can improvise without fear. → In code, you can feel where the bug is before you find it. → In life, you can see the game beneath the noise.  It’s not genius. It’s a shift from copying the marks to seeing the idea.  Once you see it, you can shape it.  Have you ever felt that shift?</h1>
