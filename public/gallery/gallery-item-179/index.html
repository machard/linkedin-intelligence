  <h1>Respect the Ride: When the Mind Goes Superluminal<br /><br />Sometimes the unanchored brain takes a problem and ignites. Suddenly you’re surfing thought at light-speed—patterns collapse, insight explodes. You’re limitless. Volatile. Alive.<br /><br />But even supernovae need gravity. Because this ride—this recursive flame—consumes time, sleep, body. It bends the frame to stretch the field.<br /><br />So if your mind goes luminous, negotiate your hours. Ride the current. Don’t drown in it.</h1>
