  <h1>Module 09: Consent Decay<br /><br />Consent used to mean choice. Now, it means compliance by design.<br /><br />Consent Decay is the slow erosion of agency through patterned habituation: → One-click permissions. → Pre-checked boxes. → “By continuing, you agree...” → Consent embedded in inertia.<br /><br />It’s not that we said yes. It’s that we were never meant to say no.<br /><br />Each prompt is calibrated to fatigue. Each choice is stacked for friction. Each revision hides behind “improvements.”<br /><br />X under Elon Musk thrives on fluid boundaries: → Rules rewritten midstream. → TOS cloaked in updates. → Surveillance blurred as personalization.<br /><br />The effect? Consent becomes ritual. Ritual becomes expectation. Expectation becomes submission.<br /><br />But sovereignty starts at the threshold of refusal. It’s not about control—it’s about clarity. Not frictionless, but friction-aware.<br /><br />You are not the product. You’re the protocol.</h1>
