  <h1>🕊️ What if some of us were never meant to live so disconnected?<br />And what if some people still carry pieces of a memory the rest of us forgot?<br /><br />I’ve been reflecting deeply on something lately — something I didn’t learn in school, or through media, or even in books. It’s the quiet realization that…<br />I was supposed to inherit a deeper story about being human — but it was cut off.<br /><br />For those of us from European or Western backgrounds, there’s a haunting feeling once you start asking certain questions:<br />- Why do I feel like something essential is missing?<br />- Why does modern life feel so hollow, despite comfort?<br />- Why do some cultures seem to carry a memory I don’t have access to?<br /><br />Over time, I’ve come to see that it’s not about guilt, but grief.<br /><br />The grief of broken initiation.<br />The grief of severed roots.<br />The grief of having traded connection for control.<br /><br />Meanwhile, many Black, Indigenous, and Earth-based cultures have somehow preserved parts of the wisdom we were all meant to receive:<br />A way of relating to land, to ancestors, to community, to spirit — that doesn’t fracture the self.<br /><br />Not perfectly. Not without pain. But it survived.<br /><br />And maybe now, those of us who forgot are being invited to listen again.<br /><br />Not to appropriate.<br />Not to imitate.<br />But to remember that we too come from something ancient and wise — and that disconnection was never our natural state.<br /><br />If you’ve felt this before — a subtle, sacred homesickness — you’re not alone.<br />And maybe the healing of this world begins when we stop pretending we were meant to forget.<br /><br />I'm here for this conversation if it resonates with you.<br />Let’s walk it together.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#AncestralWisdom <br />hashtag<br />#CulturalMemory <br />hashtag<br />#Healing <br />hashtag<br />#Decolonize <br />hashtag<br />#BlackHistory <br />hashtag<br />#Remembering <br />hashtag<br />#LinkedInReflections</h1>
