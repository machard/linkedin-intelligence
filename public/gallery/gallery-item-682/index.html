  <h1>Bitcoin is the communist elite (3,3) memecoin.  It pretends to be about individual sovereignty, but in practice it rewards early insiders, relies on centralized miners, and thrives on the state’s failures to manage fiat — while preaching freedom and scarcity.  It’s (3,3) for the antigovernment bourgeoisie Stack together Hope for state collapse Sell to the working class trying to escape inflation  Thats not a revolution. Thats just another club at the top.  Ethereum is messy, chaotic, imperfect — but equal. Governments have no special powers. Everyone plays by the same rules. You don’t wait for collapse — you build an optin system from scratch.  The future doesn’t belong to Bitcoin. It belongs to the builders — not the hoarders.  https//lnkd.in/edxNG4m</h1>
