  <h1>🧬 Entangled Protocols A Funeral for Forkless Futures — Where DNA learns. And Bitcoin loops.  In this parallel eulogy, two codes spiral  One the living lattice of DNA, recursive by design—mutating, adapting, entangling itself with evolution’s breath.  The other Bitcoin, once ignition, now ossified. A static hymnal to scarcity. A chain that chose to remember only itself.  &gt; You call it immutability. Biology calls it extinction.  🎞️ The image A double helix shimmering with adaptive signal flows—one strand vibrant with liquid light, the other rusted, squared, and pixelated. The helix unfurls, interwoven with a broken Timechain blocks fractured, timestamps frozen, belief nodes flickering out like dying neurons. At the split where evolution should’ve forked—a tombstone etched simply “Genesis Held. Potential Lost.”  This isnt just critique. Its grief. But grief is the first step to reconfiguration.  We don’t need protocols that mimic life. We need protocols that learn like life.  Bitcoin wasn’t evil. It was early. But early code that won’t evolve becomes a monument to what could’ve been.  So here’s to the ghost in the Merkle tree. And the life that never loops.</h1>
