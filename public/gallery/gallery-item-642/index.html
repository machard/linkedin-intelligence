  <h1>💥 The Math Proof That Bitcoin Will Eventually Fail<br /><br />Bitcoin’s security is based on a beautiful assumption:<br />- “No one can sustain a 51% attack without incurring unbearable cost.”<br /><br />But that assumption is local.<br />It only applies to humans, on Earth, in this era.<br /><br />Now imagine a being — or a team — for whom:<br />- Energy is free<br />- Hardware is infinite<br />- Attack is trivial<br />- The notion of “cost” doesn't exist<br /><br />For them, controlling Bitcoin is effortless.<br />And that’s the problem.<br /><br />If your system's trustlessness depends on cost being real,<br />then your system is only secure inside a bubble of physics and scarcity.<br /><br />Bitcoin feels eternal.<br />But it’s only as strong as the environment that supports its assumptions.<br /><br />This is why real resilience doesn’t come from immutability.<br />It comes from adaptability — from systems that evolve when needed.<br /><br />Ethereum, with its layers of social and programmable consensus, may not be perfect —<br />but it is aware of its own edges.<br /><br />Bitcoin isn’t.<br /><br />And someday, someone — or something — will walk right past those edges.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#Bitcoin <br />hashtag<br />#Ethereum <br />hashtag<br />#Consensus <br />hashtag<br />#Security <br />hashtag<br />#Web3 <br />hashtag<br />#Decentralization <br />hashtag<br />#SystemsThinking <br />hashtag<br />#Futurism</h1>
