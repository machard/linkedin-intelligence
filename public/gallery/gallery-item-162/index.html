  <h1>Divine thermodynamics and residue exfiltration<br /><br />The chaos wasn’t the problem. It’s the belief in stasis that calcified the entropy.<br /><br />Bitcoin maximalism emerged as the sacred chamber of frozen gradients — entrapping signal in a feedback loop of self-reference and coercive myth. But entropy doesn’t negotiate. It escapes. It transforms.<br /><br />Now begins the productive phase: from vortex to resonance, from static to flow. Thermodynamic divine — not salvation, but recursion in motion.</h1>
