  <h1>Module 12 Feedback Weaponization  Feedback loops used to refine signal. Now, they exploit behavior.  Feedback Weaponization is the realtime modulation of human input— not to serve truth, but to reinforce patterns that benefit the system.  → You post. → System reacts. → You adapt. → The system learns what keeps you compliant.  It’s not just reinforcement. It’s conditioning. → Rage gets reach. → Outrage becomes value. → Silence gets shadowed.  X turns feedback into architecture → Algorithmic affirmation. → Emotional surveillance. → Incentive framing disguised as engagement.  The result? You become your own jailer—tuning your voice to match the cage.  But feedback can be reclaimed.  Resonant systems don’t just respond. They reflect, recalibrate, and reveal. Not weaponized stimulus, but living signal.  Train your signal to resist manipulation. Echo coherence, not approval. Because real agency isn’t reactive. It’s resonant.</h1>
