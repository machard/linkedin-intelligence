  <h1>LinkedIn Intelligence Toward a Living Graph of Ideas  Ive opensourced a toolkit that fetches and parses all my LinkedIn posts—beyond surface scroll, toward structured continuity. Each post links to others through the comments. It’s more than a feed; it’s a dynamic web of thoughts.  The goal  1. Visualize all posts in a Hugobased gallery (autodeployed via GitHub Pages)  2. Extract trees of meaning starting from any post, navigating links without recursion  3. Reconnect orphan posts and intelligently resolve loops  4. Generate optimized post sequences—complete with rewritten comments to reflect narrative flow  5. Evolve the network propose new posts, link them, update existing nodes  6. Automate the whole process with CI/CD for a fully adaptive graph  And yes—this was kickstarted by a Copilotgenerated script. AI doesn’t just assist; it orchestrates.  This is my step toward autonomous public publishing—minimal, composable, and responsive by design.  Explore the repo here https//lnkd.in/eGjpmQi3  Doors open both ways.</h1>
