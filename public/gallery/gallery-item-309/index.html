  <h1>Unraveling Echoes Arabs, Africans, and the Colonial Fabric of Hispaniola  The story of Hispaniola—shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic—is often told through the lens of European conquest and African resistance. But beneath the surface lies a deeper entanglement the residual shadows of ArabAfrican relations shaped by centuries of Iberian conquest and colonial projection.  After the fall of Granada in 1492, the Spanish Crown celebrated the expulsion of the Moors—Muslims of Arab and Berber descent—as a divine victory. This triumph wasn’t just military; it was ideological. The “Saracen” became a symbol of the Other, and this crusading zeal was exported to the Caribbean. The papal bull Inter Caetera explicitly linked the conquest of the Moors to the subjugation of nonEuropeans abroad.  Thus, when enslaved Africans were brought to Hispaniola, they entered a system already coded with antiArab and antiBlack hierarchies. The Spanish viewed both groups through a lens of religious and racialized suspicion. Africans, especially those from Islamic regions, were doubly marked—as Black and as potential Moors. This led to a unique form of surveillance and suppression, particularly for enslaved Muslims who were seen as ideologically dangerous.  Yet, resistance flourished. African maroons—runaway slaves—formed autonomous communities that challenged colonial control. Some of these maroons carried Islamic traditions, oral histories, and cosmologies that echoed across the mountains of Hispaniola. Their presence disrupted the colonial narrative of conquest and revealed a deeper continuity the struggle against domination, whether in Andalusia or the Antilles.  In this light, the relationship between Arabs and Blacks in Hispaniola isn’t one of direct interaction, but of shared symbolic displacement—two groups cast as threats to empire, whose legacies of resistance continue to ripple through the island’s cultural and political fabric.</h1>
