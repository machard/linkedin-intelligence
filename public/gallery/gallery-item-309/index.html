  <h1>Module 05: Protocol Obfuscation<br /><br />The most powerful systems don’t declare themselves. They embed. They perform as neutral. They camouflage as convenience.<br /><br />Protocol Obfuscation is the tactic of hiding coercive mechanisms inside tools we trust. → The UI is friendly. → The TOS is unread. → The code is closed. → The protocol is sovereign.<br /><br />And yet… it governs speech, thought, transaction, identity.<br /><br />X becomes not just a platform—but a sovereign black box. Rules shift without notice. Reach throttled. Signals suppressed. And no one voted, yet everyone complies.<br /><br />This isn’t secrecy. It’s manufactured ambiguity. Obfuscation is a power move— Opacity as immunity.<br /><br />But there’s a counter-force.<br /><br />Transparency is not enough. Resonant architecture must emerge— Where governance is legible. Where consent is structural. Where protocol becomes invitation, not imposition.</h1>
