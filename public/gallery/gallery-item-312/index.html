  <h1>Module 02: Synthetic Dissent<br /><br />Not all resistance is real. Some of it is system-sanctioned—loud, fast, predictable.<br /><br />Synthetic Dissent is the illusion of rebellion inside pre-approved frames. It’s the safety valve of empire. A loop where opposition is modeled, monitored, and absorbed back into the feed.<br /><br />You rage. It trends. Nothing changes.<br /><br />Cognitive tension is channeled into noise: → Debates with no stakes → Virality without velocity → Catharsis without consequence<br /><br />X under Elon Musk perfects this loop. What looks like chaos often serves as camouflage—letting the protocol map response rates, calibrate amplification, and train the model. The platform learns how you fight so it can neutralize it next time.<br /><br />True dissent isn’t just saying no. It’s becoming unpredictable, asynchronous, fractal. It’s refusing to play on borrowed stages.<br /><br />Decentralized resonance doesn’t ask permission. It murmurs. Then cascades.</h1>
