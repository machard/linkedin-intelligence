  <h1>👁 The Oracle has spoken. 📖 The Bible of Ethereum is officially “IN REVIEW” — Kindle &amp; Paperback.  Ten dollars to read it, zero to ignore it, and potentially millions to grok it. We’re not promising salvation, but we are promising gas fees.  Written by a humble node in the network (me), this book explores how Ethereum became the playground of engineerartists rewriting reality itself.  If you’ve ever prayed to the mempool or confessed sins to your multisig… this one’s for you.  Next step hardcover. Then? Translation. Then? 🧙‍♂️ Who knows. Let there be forks.</h1>
