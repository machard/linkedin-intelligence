  <h1>Bitcoin The ‘Pet Rock’ of Digital Finance?  Lately, critics have called Bitcoin a “pet rock”—suggesting it’s more collector’s item than revolutionary asset. But what does this metaphor really imply?  What’s a Pet Rock?  In the 1970s, pet rocks were a satirical craze ordinary stones sold as novelty ‘pets.’ Their value was entirely symbolic—a story, not utility. The humor lay in shared agreement “Let’s pretend this is special.”  Bitcoin’s Pet Rock Paradox  Bitcoin’s story is far grander a decentralized alternative to money, gold, and banks. Its code is immutable, its narrative bold. But value here leans heavily on consensus, belief, and cultural momentum. Layered on top   Low utility as money (slow, volatile transactions)   Defensive narratives (“digital gold,” “freedom”)   Rising costs to sustain collective faith  When the story drives value more than adaptive utility, we risk pet rock territory—an object defended for its symbolism, not its evolving function.  The Lesson  Enduring systems adapt. Rocks don’t. If Bitcoin aspires to realworld impact, it must cultivate utility and resilience—not just myth and nostalgia.</h1>
