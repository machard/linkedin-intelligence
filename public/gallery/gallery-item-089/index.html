  <h1>🚀 Bitcoin: The New Corporate Rite of Passage? 🥸<br /><br />Remember when climbing the career ladder meant mastering Excel macros or surviving your first team offsite? Well, that's so 2015. Today’s rite of passage: buying Bitcoin, holding through a dip, and explaining your investment thesis to your skeptical aunt at Thanksgiving.<br /><br />Initiation goes like this:<br />1. “It’s digital gold!” you proclaim, eyes shimmering with hope.<br />2. Market dips 30%. Existential reflection intensifies.<br />3. You Google “What is a seed phrase?” at 2am.<br />4. You tweet diamond hands, but your palms are sweating.<br />5. Eventually, you emerge: not rich, but now fluent in both memes and monetary policy.<br /><br />Congrats, you’re through the spiral. Next step: create a meme to prove it. <br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#CryptoCulture <br />hashtag<br />#RiteOfPassage <br />hashtag<br />#ResonantFinance</h1>
