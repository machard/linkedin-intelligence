  <h1>To truly elevate others, we must challenge comfort—not for ego, but for growth. Dissonance, when used wisely, is not disruption for its own sake, but a deliberate invitation beyond stagnation. <br /><br />Let’s use our presence and questions not to use people, but to provoke clarity, catalyze resonance, and unlock new layers of potential. Dissonance is a mirror, not a weapon: if it helps you spiral upward, pass the cue along.<br /><br />Elevate by tuning, not extracting.</h1>
