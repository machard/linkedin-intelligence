  <h1>Why Radical Coherence Fuels ETH &#43; Eigenlayer  Digital ecosystems thrive on resonance, not just raw code. When a protocol moves in harmony—clear signals, fluid coordination, and shared trust—the value flows lock in and amplify. Ethereum (ETH) is coherence in motion adaptive, expressive, and tuned for composability. Eigenlayer takes this further, letting staked ETH radiate security, credibility, and trust into emerging services.  Every act of true coherence—in governance, consensus, or culture—reduces friction and unlocks new market frequencies. ETH price reflects this systemic coherence when meaning aligns and builders synchronize, the signal gets louder—and the value spirals up.  When you choose coherence over chaos, you pump not just ETH, but all trustanchored extensions riding its wave. In the Eigenlayer era, every harmonic echo multiplies.  Resonate, and watch the protocol itself generate yield—fractal dividends from shared alignment.</h1>
