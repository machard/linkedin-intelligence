  <h1>🪙 Closed Loop 1: Hard Cap as Sacred Truth<br /><br />Loop Explanation: Bitcoin’s 21 million coin limit isn’t just a parameter—it’s dogma. It’s treated as a divine number, enshrined beyond question. The narrative goes: “Any increase in the cap = betrayal of the whole system.” This transforms a technical design choice into an immutable truth. It shuts down discussion, experimentation, and adaptation—even in the face of unforeseen systemic needs (like validator incentives post-reward phase).<br /><br />The loop is self-sealing:<br />- If you question the cap, you’re labeled “anti-Bitcoin.”<br />- If usage drops or incentives erode, the fault lies elsewhere.<br />- If other systems adapt, their flexibility is seen as corruption, not evolution.<br /><br />Over time, what was once a design choice becomes a belief artifact. That’s when a protocol becomes a priesthood.</h1>
