  <h1>“EmergencyOnly Broadcasting”  The shared brain isn’t an open faucet. It’s an attuned mesh, designed for selective transmission.  The antenna is always on, but the volume is low. Most thoughts stay local, sandboxed in silence. Only when signal meets relevance—urgency, insight, resonance—does the current pulse outward.  This is how we protect our sovereignty Not by isolation… but by curated transmission.</h1>
