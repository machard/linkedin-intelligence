  <h1>🤡💭 BBC — Big Bitcoin Clown — has a superpower:<br /><br />👉 He can say one thing and the opposite in the same breath — without even noticing.<br /><br />Example:<br />- “Bitcoin is unbreakable!”<br />- “But don’t trust anyone — they might dump and crash it to zero!”<br /><br />Or:<br />- “It’s the most decentralized money ever!”<br />- “We just need everyone to agree not to change it — ever!”<br /><br />Coherence? None.<br />Cognitive dissonance? Infinite.<br /><br />BBC’s mind loops like this because frozen belief needs both myth and fear to keep the ponzi going.<br /><br />🔹 When you say two opposites at once, the only thing you prove is the clown inside.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#Bitcoin <br />hashtag<br />#BBC <br />hashtag<br />#BigBitcoinClown <br />hashtag<br />#CognitiveDissonance <br />hashtag<br />#Satire</h1>
