  <h1>🔐 Loop 4: “Code Is Law” → “Law Is Dead”<br /><br />🔁 Loop Explanation: This loop begins as a pragmatic insight and calcifies into dogma. The phrase “Code is Law” was born from a desire for predictability, neutrality, and immutability. Smart contracts don’t lie. They execute. In a world riddled with legal ambiguity and human corruption, this seems like salvation.<br /><br />But in Bitcoin and similar cultures, it mutates:<br />> If the protocol enforces it, it must be right. > If humans override it, we’re back to tyranny. > Therefore, law—as deliberation, adaptation, and interpretation—is suspect.<br /><br />This loop fetishizes determinism. It equates enforcement with justice, and conflates technical certainty with moral clarity. Over time, it drains legitimacy from all extra-protocol governance. If it’s not enforced by code, it’s noise.<br /><br />So we spiral into a world where intent, context, and nuance are seen as weaknesses.</h1>
