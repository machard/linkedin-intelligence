  <h1>ðŸ§¬ Emmanuelle Charpentier<br /><br />A French microbiologist and geneticist, Charpentier is best known for co-discovering CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary genome-editing tool that has transformed biology and medicine. Alongside Jennifer Doudna, she received the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistryâ€”the first time two women shared a science Nobel without male co-recipients.<br /><br />Her work began with studying bacterial immune systems, but what she uncovered was a programmable method to cut and edit DNA with unprecedented precision. She later co-founded CRISPR Therapeutics, pushing the boundaries of gene therapy and biotechnology. Charpentier now leads the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens in Berlin, continuing to explore the molecular choreography of life.</h1>
