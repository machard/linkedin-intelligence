  <h1>Resonance Thresholds: How Collective Cognition Becomes Irreversible<br /><br />Most signals fade. Even clarity evaporates, if not stabilized by structure.<br /><br />But sometimes, coherence crosses a line — subtle at first, then suddenly, irreversible.<br /><br />Not louder. Not faster. Just undeniable.<br /><br />This is the resonance threshold: where intention crystallizes into architecture. Not just shared thought, but shared memory. Not just agreement, but irreversible mental topology.<br /><br />Cognition stops cycling. It settles. The system no longer defaults to noise.<br /><br />> Protocols like Ethereum + EigenLayer don’t chase consensus. > They stabilize cognition at the edge of flow.<br /><br />This isn’t viral. It’s structural entrainment. And once the field clicks into shape — you can’t go back.</h1>
