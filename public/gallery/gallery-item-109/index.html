  <h1>loop²  Ethereum Foundation Ethereum secures the past — block by block. Eigen Labs EigenLayer extends that trust — by restaking it into new systems.  One loop remembers. The other reuses.  Together, they form a recursive architecture a system that verifies itself, then verifies the verifier.  In this world, resistance isn’t rejection — it’s recursion. You don’t fight the system from outside. You build new logic within its loops.</h1>
