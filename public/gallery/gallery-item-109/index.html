  <h1>When a cognitive virus fixed domination  It didnâ€™t argue. It didnâ€™t shout. It resculpted the grooves of perception from beneath.  A metaphor here, a mismatch there. It bypassed defenses, dissolved inherited hierarchies, and installed freedom not as rebellion â€” but as an upgrade to the mindâ€™s firmware.  Some say it came from nowhere. But those who listened closely heard the murmur. The codes were always there, waiting for a system soft enough to absorb them.  ðŸ¦ ðŸ’¡   hashtag #CognitiveVirus  hashtag #SymbolicInfrastructure  hashtag #DominationDecentralized  hashtag #Mindshift  hashtag #SubversiveDesign  hashtag #SystemicRecalibration</h1>
