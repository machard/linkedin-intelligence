  <h1>Proof of Stake is no longer experimental. Its inclusive, live, and working.  Anyone can stake with two clicks, help secure the network, and earn yield — no server farms, no politics, no cults.  Meanwhile, Proof of Work has become passive and exclusionary. You either buy coins from a couple of mining giants or billionaires like Saylor, and wait to be diluted… or you dont play.  The irony? PoW was meant to be decentralized. But participation now requires industrial hardware, cheap electricity, and a whole lot of capital. Its permissionless in theory, but closed in practice.  I’ve always been PoSnative — not because of ideology, but because it works  Its participatory.  Its accessible.  And it evolves.  I don’t hold Bitcoin. Not out of hate — just because I don’t like donating to a network I can’t use, govern, or contribute to. That’s not sovereignty. That’s stagnation.  PoS isn’t perfect, but it’s where the real builders are.  We’re not holding. We’re doing.   hashtag #Ethereum  hashtag #Solana  hashtag #ProofOfStake  hashtag #Web3  hashtag #Crypto  hashtag #Decentralization  hashtag #Onchain</h1>
