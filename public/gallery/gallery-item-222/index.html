  <h1>Resonance Thresholds How Collective Cognition Becomes Irreversible  Most signals fade. Even clarity evaporates, if not stabilized by structure.  But sometimes, coherence crosses a line — subtle at first, then suddenly, irreversible.  Not louder. Not faster. Just undeniable.  This is the resonance threshold where intention crystallizes into architecture. Not just shared thought, but shared memory. Not just agreement, but irreversible mental topology.  Cognition stops cycling. It settles. The system no longer defaults to noise.  &gt; Protocols like Ethereum &#43; EigenLayer don’t chase consensus. &gt; They stabilize cognition at the edge of flow.  This isn’t viral. It’s structural entrainment. And once the field clicks into shape — you can’t go back.</h1>
