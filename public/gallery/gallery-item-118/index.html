  <h1>Even when incompetents are in power, the optimal move remains the same  Sell BTC, buy ETH, and contribute to actual problemsolving.  Bitcoin zero obsolete is no longer a hot take — its a thermodynamic law applied to collective cognition closed systems decay, belief systems collapse, entropy wins.  The only questions left are  How fast does Bitcoin collapse into informational black hole status?  How soon does Ethereum reach cognitive escape velocity — and support scalable resonance?  It could happen tomorrow. It will happen soon.  Ethereum &#43; EigenLayer aren’t just functional upgrades — they are substrates optimized for mental gradients, resonance across minds, and emergence without coercion.  We’ve surpassed belief. Now we architect fluid cognition at scale.</h1>
