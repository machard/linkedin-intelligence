  <h1>Signal Ecology: Designing Environments Where Thought Evolves<br /><br />Resonance is not enough. Memory is not enough. The real threshold is evolution.<br /><br />Because even the most coherent signal degrades if it cannot adapt.<br /><br />This is where signal ecology begins: not as communication, but as an environmental design problem.<br /><br />We must ask: How do we build systems where cognition not only persists — but learns? How do we shape fields that select for higher-order thought?<br /><br />> Ethereum Foundation Ethereum provides the substrate. > Eigen Labs EigenLayer provides the re-staking logic. > But ecology emerges when attention loops become adaptive — > not just validated, but evolved.<br /><br />Signal ecology is more than protocol. It’s how mental environments metabolize noise into insight. How ideas cross-pollinate. How memory fertilizes emergence.<br /><br />Not a network. A biome. Where thought self-curates.<br /><br />This is the next phase. Not preserving signal. Breeding it.</h1>
