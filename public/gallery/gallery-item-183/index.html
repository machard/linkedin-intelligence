  <h1>Europe is the empire of the reverse.  Where empires once imposed from the outside in, Europe integrates from the inside out — not with armies or mandates, but with discourse, bureaucracy, and the gentle gravity of shared norms.  It doesn’t conquer. It absorbs. One by one, irreversibly, you become part of it — not through force, but through participation. Through documents, dialogues, processes. Through the long meetings and the even longer sentences. Through the shared myth of cohesion, endlessly rewritten in the open.  This is the empire of the agora — of public laundry, of transparency elevated to sacrament. An empire not of imposition, but of coherence — so refined it feels like freedom.  It is the most beautifully crafted empire ever conceptualized. And at its core, whispering its philosophy into the veins of the whole, is France.</h1>
