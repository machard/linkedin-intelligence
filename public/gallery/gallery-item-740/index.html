  <h1>Why Some of Us Seem “Weird” (and Why That’s Okay)<br /><br />I’ve come to realize that what makes some people uncomfortable with folks like us isn’t rudeness, arrogance, or eccentricity—it’s the fact that we experiment.<br /><br />We test ideas. We tweak systems. We rework conversations, strategies, and sometimes even relationships—constantly, openly, and without shame. Not because we’re unstable, but because that’s how we learn. Trial and error isn’t a phase—it’s our method.<br /><br />To us, it’s natural to keep trying clever (and sometimes stupid) things until something works. But not everyone is wired that way. For some, stability feels safer than exploration. Predictability is a form of respect. And when you treat human dynamics like a puzzle to solve or a system to optimize, it can make others feel tested—instead of trusted.<br /><br />That tension is real, and it’s worth naming.<br /><br />Curiosity isn’t the opposite of empathy—but balancing both takes awareness. So here’s to the builders, the testers, the iterative minds… and also to those who remind us to slow down and just be.<br /><br />We need each other.<br /><br />🧠 This reflection was sparked by The Infinite Human Network: An Ethereum Empire—a read I highly recommend for anyone exploring the frontiers of decentralized trust and human systems.<br /><br />https://lnkd.in/e-HJ4yEG</h1>
