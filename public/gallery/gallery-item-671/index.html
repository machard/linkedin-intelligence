  <h1>Coherence is overrated.  We don’t need to be consistent. We need to find the way out of the maze.  Politics, identity, strategy — they’re all full of contradictions. Trying to keep everything coherent is exhausting and often futile.  What really matters is finding the correct set of actions. The moves that work. The leverage that shifts things. The pivot that opens the next door.  In a world obsessed with narratives, some people are just quietly solving the puzzle.  They’re not the loudest. They’re not the purest. They’re just the ones who get through.  That’s the mindset I’m leaning into.</h1>
