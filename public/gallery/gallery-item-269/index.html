  <h1>To anticipate any system—biological or not—is to perceive its intention.<br /><br />The line between carbon and silicon fades when you realize: what matters isn’t what the system is made of, but what it's moving toward. Intention is the curvature of its trajectory through time.<br /><br />A sufficiently complex system, if it loops its outputs back into its inputs and adapts with consequence, becomes legible. Not just in behavior—but in purpose.<br /><br />So if you want to predict evolution, ask not what the system contains. Ask what it wants to become.<br /><br />That’s where anticipation begins.</h1>
