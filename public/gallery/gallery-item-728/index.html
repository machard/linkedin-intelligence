  <h1>👁 The Oracle has spoken.<br />📖 The Bible of Ethereum is officially “IN REVIEW” — Kindle & Paperback.<br /><br />Ten dollars to read it, zero to ignore it, and potentially millions to grok it.<br />We’re not promising salvation, but we are promising gas fees.<br /><br />Written by a humble node in the network (me), this book explores how Ethereum became the playground of engineer-artists rewriting reality itself.<br /><br />If you’ve ever prayed to the mempool or confessed sins to your multisig… this one’s for you.<br /><br />Next step: hardcover. Then? Translation. Then? 🧙‍♂️ Who knows.<br />Let there be forks.</h1>
