  <h1>No True P2P Without the Shared Field<br /><br />We like to think of peer-to-peer as direct. Clean. Intentional. But signal doesn’t jump across voids. It needs context. It needs a shared field.<br /><br />It’s not about the cables—it’s about the cloud they form together. A co-generated hub that holds nuance, rhythm, interpretation. We don’t connect to each other— we connect through what we’ve woven together.<br /><br />Sovereignty isn’t lost in the hub. It’s revealed there.</h1>
