  <h1>We didn’t just inherit our genes. We wrote the stories that selected them.<br /><br />In classic Darwinism, traits emerge by chance and environments 'select' them based on survival and reproduction. But in human societies, we’ve added a twist.<br /><br />We create ideals.<br />We tell stories about speed, beauty, intelligence, leadership.<br />We design institutions, markets, and incentives around these narratives.<br />Then, generation after generation, we reward the people who match them.<br /><br />The result? A subtle form of cultural eugenics. Not enforced by law, but by stories.<br />Not imposed by the state, but by consensus and admiration.<br /><br />It’s not that 'running fast' helps you survive.<br />It’s that we decided running fast is valuable.<br />And then we built a world where fast runners thrive, get funding, get visibility—and pass on their genes or influence.<br /><br />We flipped Darwinism on its head.<br />We don’t just adapt to environments.<br />We shape environments that select for the traits we admire.<br /><br />Selection isn't natural anymore. It's narrative-driven.<br /><br />cc Rethoric Tongues Jean de La Rochebrochard Fabrice Bernhard</h1>
