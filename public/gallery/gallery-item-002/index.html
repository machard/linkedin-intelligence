  <h1>🤡🧠 BBC — Big Bitcoin Clown — just had a moment of clarity.<br /><br />He looked at his wallet…<br />He looked at the chart…<br /><br />👉 And realized he has no idea why he bought it in the first place.<br /><br />Was it freedom? Sovereignty? Getting rich? Beating the banks?<br /><br />All he remembers is: “Number go up.”<br /><br />But when belief is just a meme and the exit is just “HODL forever,” you end up like BBC:<br />Laughing, holding the bag — no idea why.<br /><br />🔹 Coherence is a system. Confusion is a cult.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#Bitcoin <br />hashtag<br />#BBC <br />hashtag<br />#BigBitcoinClown <br />hashtag<br />#Satire <br />hashtag<br />#ForgetWhy</h1>
