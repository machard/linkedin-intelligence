  <h1>🥕 Why Bitcoin when you can just believe in the Carrot Standard?<br /><br />Some say Bitcoin is “sound money.” But is it really more stable than a carrot? <br />- Carrots have intrinsic value (delicious, full of vitamin A). <br />- Carrots resist inflation (unless you’re really hungry). <br />- You can’t eat a Bitcoin, but you can eat a carrot. <br />- Try losing your private carrot—nature just makes more.<br /><br />Carrot maximalists know: the real store of value grows in the ground, not on the blockchain. <br />In a world obsessed with digital gold, maybe it’s time to diversify into root vegetables. 🥕<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#CarrotStandard <br />hashtag<br />#VegetableFi <br />hashtag<br />#RootedInValue</h1>
