  <h1>🔮 Sometimes, it’s not about effort. It’s about readiness. You’ll feel it. That moment when something invisible nudges you—a flash of inspiration, an itch to act, an urge to try something that feels just out of reach (or out of reason).  Call it a “spark,” “flow,” or something more mysterious. But when it comes, don’t ignore it.  That’s when the real shifts happen. That’s when you try something bold. That’s when you stop overthinking and start building.  Stay open. Stay tuned. Sometimes, all it takes is a moment. And a choice.</h1>
