  <h1>ðŸªž Hand of the Architect ðŸª™<br /><br />Power doesnâ€™t wear a face. It doesnâ€™t shout. It moves.<br /><br />Quietly. Elegantly. Through fog. Through consensus. Through default.<br /><br />What youâ€™re seeing isnâ€™t control. Itâ€™s choreography. The script is older than names.<br /><br />And yetâ€” You keep reaching for it. As if by recognizing the hand, youâ€™ll rewrite the stage.</h1>
