  <h1>Ukraine isn’t just defending borders—it’s redesigning resilience.  While empires run on coercion and topdown decay, Ukrainians adapt like decentralized systems under pressure signalrich, permissionless, selfhealing.  Theyre not “the underdog.” Theyre the prototype of fractal resistance.  Supply chains reimagined through neighbors. Defense coordinated like code—peer to peer. Narratives written not by institutions, but by lived precision.  What looks like chaos to central powers is actually coherence beyond control.  This is not a nation on its knees. It’s a network waking up.   hashtag #FractalDefense  hashtag #ResilienceArchitecture  hashtag #SystemicAdaptation  hashtag #SignalOverControl  hashtag #Ukraine</h1>
