  <h1>When the Crazy Brain Flies the Ship<br /><br />Most people don’t realize there's a cockpit. So when the unanchored brain seizes control— all impulse, no compass—it feels normal. But that’s not chaos. <br /><br />That’s absence of agency.<br /><br />The wild mind isn’t the enemy. It’s power unpiloted. And when the conscious self steps in—not to suppress, but to harmonize— you get co-piloting.<br /><br />Structure meets emergence. Impulse meets intention. And the ship? It sings.</h1>
