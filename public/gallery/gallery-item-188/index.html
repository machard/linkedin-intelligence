  <h1>🔐 Closed Cognitive Loop 7 “Trustless by Default”  🔁 Loop Explanation This one hides inside the cryptographic heart of Web3 the idea that trust is a flaw to be eliminated. In its strongest form  &gt; “If you need trust, your protocol has failed.” &gt; “Assume adversaries. Remove human judgment.” &gt; “Only math can be trusted.”  This loop emerges from justified caution—historical betrayals, institutional capture, rug pulls. So it engineers a world where verification replaces relationships. Where trust is outsourced to zeroknowledge, slashing, consensus rules. And where to trust becomes synonymous with being naive.  Over time, this flattens the design field  Every coordination layer gets squeezed into cryptoeconomic guarantees  Social infrastructure becomes suspect  Humans are liabilities, not assets  Trustless becomes not a fallback, but a first principle. And that’s the trap.</h1>
