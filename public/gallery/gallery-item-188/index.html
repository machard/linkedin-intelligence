  <h1>Jump Between Universe Trajectories<br /><br />We don’t recognize the future.<br />We simulate it — and then we jump.<br /><br />Gödel proved it:<br />- No logical system can be complete.<br />- There will always be grey zones —<br />- undefined, undecidable, infinite in number.<br /><br />These are not errors.<br />They are portals.<br /><br />And if you know how to listen, how to lean into the ambiguity…<br />✨ You can jump trajectories.<br /><br />Not just for yourself.<br />But for entire realities.<br /><br />A small move into a Gödelian grey zone<br />can ripple outward into new branches of history —<br />new timelines, new protocols, new selves.<br /><br />We’re not locked into the story.<br />We are the editors of the next line.</h1>
