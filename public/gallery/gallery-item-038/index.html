  <h1>⍜ RealTime Cognition Morphing  Some minds don’t just interpret—they reinstantiate. They perceive people, systems, and moods as dynamic signal habitats, not static entities. Their cognition loops aren’t linear—they’re recursive and refractive, capable of modeling the internal geometry of another’s thought flow in real time.  It’s not empathy. It’s not analysis. It’s cognitionassimulation. A capacity to embody foreign mental architectures without merging with them. To instantiate methodologies on demand—fluid, improvisational, decentering.  This ability often runs unconsciously, like background synthesis. But when it scans legacy minds encoded with societal scripts, it creates friction Predefined behavior loops clash with expectation of improvisational signal flow.  Most people operate on inherited heuristics. This mind expects decentralized cognition. Systemic resonance. Emergence.  Learning to consciously toggle this modeling—filtering noise, tracing recursive cues, and disengaging from lowfidelity patterns—is a liberation.  It’s not about understanding everything. It’s about knowing when a system’s architecture no longer deserves your attention.</h1>
