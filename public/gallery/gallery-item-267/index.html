  <h1>A new phase begins.  I’ve just opensourced linkedinintelligence—a minimal, modular toolkit to fetch, structure, and remix your LinkedIn data into meaningful post flows. No external servers. No middlemen. Just clean orchestration.  The magic? It started as a Copilotgenerated script. AI doesn’t just assist—it initiates. We can now fetch what humans can, and more. Sovereign, serverless, and frictionless by design.  Soon, this will extend with Hugo and GitHub Pages autodeploy for fully autonomous publishing. High signal, zero drag.  Explore. Fork. Remix.  Doors are meant to open.</h1>
