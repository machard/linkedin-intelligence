  <h1>Control engineers predictability. Emergence reveals possibility.<br /><br />Bitcoin is code obsessed with control. Finality. Consensus. Unchangeable truth.<br /><br />But systems don’t evolve by holding on — they evolve by letting go. Emergence isn’t chaos. It’s coherence without control.<br /><br />EigenLayer doesn’t enforce form — it cultivates alignment. Coordination that isn’t commanded, but revealed through interaction.<br /><br />Control builds walls. Emergence builds worlds.</h1>
