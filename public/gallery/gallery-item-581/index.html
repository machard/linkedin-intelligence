  <h1>Modeling the evolution of a decentralized mesh through adaptive agents.  OpenStreaming redefines fluidity. But what happens when autonomous agents—each with internal logic and external constraints—shape the network’s evolution?   Internal rules drive strategic behaviors optimization, redundancy, disruption.  External forces reshape pathways network stress, economic shifts, emergent feedback loops.  Convergence vs. divergence—balancing harmony with necessary disruption.  This isn’t just simulation—it’s a selforganizing experiment in decentralized coordination.  ♟️ The chessboard evolves. The system adapts. The multiverse expands.  🚀 The next move is ours.  🔗 https//lnkd.in/e8pNpqSn  cc The Nobel Prize Hervé Biausser</h1>
