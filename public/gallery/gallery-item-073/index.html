  <h1>🧠 Bitcoin Maximalism as a Cognitive Ponzi<br /><br />It’s not about fraud in the legal sense. It’s about belief recursion.<br /><br />A Ponzi scheme requires constant inflow to sustain earlier promises. Bitcoin Maximalism requires constant ideological reinforcement to sustain its narrative.<br /><br />- Early adopters: rewarded not just financially, but with mythic status.<br />- Newcomers: recruited into a worldview, not just a protocol.<br />- Returns: not in yield, but in confirmation — that Bitcoin is the one true chain.<br /><br />The “Ponzi” isn’t in the code. It’s in the cognitive structure: A loop where belief sustains belief, and dissent is framed as ignorance.<br /><br />Ethereum broke that loop for you. It showed that coordination doesn’t require dogma. That evolution doesn’t need a savior script.</h1>
