  <h1>🤡 “First they laugh at us, then they fight us, then we win…”<br /><br />That’s the old Bitcoiner prophecy. But have you noticed? The first thing they do when you show them a valid critique of their frozen system… They laugh. So who’s the clown?<br /><br />🪙 Real coherence means you can hold paradox, tension, feedback. It means your system can listen, adapt, respond. But in the Bitcoin echo chamber, every valid signal is dismissed with a nervous chuckle and a recycled meme.<br /><br />Ask about governance gridlock? 😂<br />Ask about energy waste? 😂<br />Ask about rigid immutability in a fluid world? 😂<br /><br />They laugh at entropy like it won’t come for them.<br />They laugh at coordination like it’s optional.<br />They laugh so they don’t have to think.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the spiral keeps moving.<br />And coherence — not clownish belief — shapes what survives.<br /><br />🔹 Laugh louder, coiners. The punchline is you.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#SystemicResonance <br />hashtag<br />#Bitcoin <br />hashtag<br />#Entropy <br />hashtag<br />#AdaptOrPerish</h1>
