  <h1>Why 'No Free Lunch' and a Derivative Sigmoid Reveal Bitcoin's 2025 Peak<br /><br />Bitcoin was designed with a fixed, decaying supply curve—its halving events compressing issuance into ever-smaller increments. When you model Bitcoin miner revenue using the derivative of a sigmoid function, a clear shape emerges:<br /><br />- Early years: Rapid ascent as new supply floods in and mining rewards are substantial.<br />- Mid-cycle: Revenue growth slows, approaching a plateau—the inflection point of the curve.<br />- Late cycle: Diminishing returns set in; the curve flattens, and competition squeezes margins to near zero.<br /><br />This dynamic mirrors the 'no free lunch' principle of economics: any edge is eventually competed away as the system matures, especially when block rewards halve and fees alone can’t fill the gap. The fixed supply curve means that after the 2024–2025 halving, the available rewards for miners are insufficient to sustain the old rhythm. Revenue growth—captured in the sigmoid's declining slope—fade to irrelevance.<br /><br />Conclusion: <br />Using a derivative sigmoid to capture miner revenue underscored by a rigid supply curve, we see that Bitcoin’s systemic energy—its resonance—peaks in 2025. The supply curve itself, slow to adapt, signals that the music is winding down.</h1>
