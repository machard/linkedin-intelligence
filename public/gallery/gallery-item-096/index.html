  <h1>Why do Bitcoiners seem so obsessed with Ethereum lately? Maybe it’s brain envy.  While the Ethereum crowd is busy iterating, experimenting, and weaving new possibilities, Bitcoiners are still polishing their “digital gold”—hoping one day it’ll move on its own (spoiler it won’t).   Rigid chains preserve history; adaptive minds invent the future.  Sorry Bitcoiners, resonance requires more than just holding tight—you have to think fluid, not just HODL.  🧠✨ Fluidity beats fossilization, every cycle.</h1>
