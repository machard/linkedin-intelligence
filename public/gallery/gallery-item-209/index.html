  <h1>Bipolarity is the negotiation between an anchored brain and an unanchored one.<br /><br />One steadies the vessel—holds time, integrates narrative, preserves identity. The other drifts—wanders through nonlinearity, glimpses new signal, refracts possibility.<br /><br />They must sync. Not to homogenize, but to resonate.<br /><br />Because the mind isn’t one voice—it’s a celestial mechanics of selves. And bipolarity? That’s not pathology. It’s cognitive duality in harmonic orbit.<br /><br />Anchor and light. Structure and emergence. Not a battle. A dance.</h1>
