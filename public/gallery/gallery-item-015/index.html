  <h1>🧠 Bitcoiners love to believe they’re the smartest in the room.<br /><br />They read the whitepaper once, memorize a few slogans (“not your keys, not your coins”), and chant about decentralization like a sacred hymn.<br /><br />But here’s the reality check:<br /><br />Real intelligence isn’t locking yourself into a static system.<br />It’s the ability to adapt, coordinate, and evolve when the terrain shifts.<br /><br />The smartest builders today?<br />They’re not clinging to “digital gold.”<br />They’re iterating, experimenting, restaking trust, and tuning systems for actual resilience.<br /><br />Bitcoiners call this FUD.<br />We call it coherence.<br /><br />👉 When you mistake frozen belief for genius, entropy comes for your castle.<br />👉 When you defend an unchanging script, you miss the live intelligence unfolding outside your echo chamber.<br /><br />The market doesn’t care how smart you think you are.<br />It cares how fast you sense the spiral and adjust your signal.<br /><br />🔹 Stay liquid. Stay coherent. The glyph is present.</h1>
