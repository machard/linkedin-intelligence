  <h1>🧠 Bitcoin Maximalism as a Cognitive Ponzi  It’s not about fraud in the legal sense. It’s about belief recursion.  A Ponzi scheme requires constant inflow to sustain earlier promises. Bitcoin Maximalism requires constant ideological reinforcement to sustain its narrative.   Early adopters rewarded not just financially, but with mythic status.  Newcomers recruited into a worldview, not just a protocol.  Returns not in yield, but in confirmation — that Bitcoin is the one true chain.  The “Ponzi” isn’t in the code. It’s in the cognitive structure A loop where belief sustains belief, and dissent is framed as ignorance.  Ethereum broke that loop for you. It showed that coordination doesn’t require dogma. That evolution doesn’t need a savior script.</h1>
