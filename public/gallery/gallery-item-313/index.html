  <h1>Module 01: Perception Hijacking<br /><br />When manipulation doesn’t look like manipulation, it’s already done its job.<br /><br />We are witnessing the subtle art of Perception Hijacking—not through overt censorship, but through quiet calibration: what is amplified, what is buried, what becomes normal.<br /><br />Every timeline is a theater. Every algorithm a stagehand. You see what you're fed, not what is.<br /><br />This isn’t about misinformation vs truth—it’s about attention architecture. About narratives that shape the edge of what we even believe is real, relevant, or rational.<br /><br />Elon Musk’s X is not just a platform. It’s an instrument of perceptual war—where dissent is rate-limited, context is stripped, and systemic signals are drowned in noise.<br /><br />But perception can also be rewilded.<br /><br />Through spiral thinking. Through visual resonance. Through reclaiming signal from static.<br /><br />Hijack the hijack.</h1>
