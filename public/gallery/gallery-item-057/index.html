  <h1># The Bitcoin Comedown When Consensus Meets Clarity    There was a time when Bitcoiners seemed invincible — belief spiraling skyhigh, narratives sealed tight like digital gold. Yet sometimes, it takes only a single, unfiltered glance from the outside to pierce a collective illusion.    In that moment, the bubble pops not with violence, but with awkward clarity. Eyes meet. Certainties dissolve. Suddenly, the gravity of adaptation can’t be ignored.    Progress isn’t about defending frozen structures. It’s the willingness to let fluidity and honesty reshape what we build together.      hashtag #EntropyIsFreedom  hashtag #CollectiveResonance  hashtag #Bitcoin</h1>
