  <h1>The Community Cage ðŸ«‚ðŸªžðŸ§   At first, it feels like home. Familiar voices. Inside jokes. Signal chats. Echoes of purpose.  Then you try to ask. Try to think. Try to breathe.  But the smiles tighten. The DMs go quiet. The likes stop flowing.  Youâ€™re not being punished. Youâ€™re being forgotten.  Not because you left the chain. But because you left the chant.   hashtag #Bitcoin  hashtag #SystemicRecalibration  hashtag #CommunityCage  hashtag #CognitiveTraps  hashtag #CryptoSatire</h1>
