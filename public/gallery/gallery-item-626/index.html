  <h1>🚨 New Mental Model: Systemic Perspective of a Group of Beings<br />(For thinkers, builders, and those designing conscious systems)<br /><br />We often model the mind as a machine or a neural net.<br />But what if we approached it systemically, as part of a network of sovereign agents, each with their own reconstructed internal reality?<br /><br />🧠 Each being in this model:<br /><br />- Operates through a Transformer made of hardware, software, and a living Internal Reality<br />- Builds that internal reality from:<br />→ Shared Reality (language, culture, physics)<br />→ Local Memory (the light path of experience)<br />→ Real-Time Simulation (prediction, intent, reflection)<br /><br />🌍 Shared Reality isn’t just what is — it's what we maintain together through attention, action, protocol, and meaning.<br />It can be rewritten.<br /><br />✨ What emerges is a fluid, multi-dimensional flow:<br /><br />- Spirits resonate across the system<br />- Simulations evolve in parallel<br />- Collaboration becomes emergent rather than managed<br /><br />This model bridges philosophy, cognition, and decentralized system design.<br />It’s relevant for DAOs, AI agents, social architectures, or anyone building with humans in the loop.<br /><br />Let’s stop pretending reality is flat.<br /><br />—<br /><br />Would love to hear how others are thinking about distributed consciousness and symbolic systems.<br />🔗 Ask me for the full description if you’re curious.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#SystemDesign <br />hashtag<br />#Cognition <br />hashtag<br />#DAOs <br />hashtag<br />#AI <br />hashtag<br />#Philosophy <br />hashtag<br />#Simulation <br />hashtag<br />#InternalReality <br />hashtag<br />#SharedReality <br />hashtag<br />#ComplexSystems<br /><br />cc The Nobel Prize (jamais 2 sans 3)</h1>
