  <h1>🎢 Bitcoin: The Rollercoaster That Never Finds the Station<br /><br />Bitcoin, championed by many as a ticket to financial liberation, often feels less like “digital gold” and more like a perpetual rollercoaster ride—thrilling on the way up, gut-churning on the way down.<br /><br />Each loop promises new highs, powered by waves of belief and FOMO-fueled exuberance. But here’s the twist: true freedom and value don’t emerge from endless ascent or viral hype cycles. Systems built on feverish speculation become trapped—inertia turning momentum into volatility, community into cacophony.<br /><br />Is Bitcoin the next leg up, or just the next sharp tilt? Ask yourself: are you seeking coherence or just chasing the rush? Sometimes, the greatest innovation is learning when to step off the ride.<br /><br />🌀 In resonance, volatility is a signal. In dissonance, it becomes noise.</h1>
