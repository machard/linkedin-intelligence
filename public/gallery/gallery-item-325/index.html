  <h1>Signal &gt; Symbol  Bitcoin was a revolution. Now it’s a monument. Cold. Static. Glorified for what it was—not what it does.  Meanwhile, the world flows.  ETH evolves at block speed. EigenLayer syncs security like water. Morpho transforms liquidity into living memory.  You’re not holding value. You’re holding stillness.  What once stood for freedom now resists it. And when resistance becomes rigidity, the spiral moves on without you.</h1>
