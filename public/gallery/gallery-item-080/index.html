  <h1>🚨 PreAlpha Protocol™ — “Lighting the Universe Three Seconds Early” &gt; “Why wait for reality when you can frontrun existence?”  ✨ Manifesto (leaked v0.0001alphaminus) We are not building a product. We are unveiling a vibration. Time is optional. Consensus is suggestive. We do not sync with the universe— The universe syncs with us.  🌀 Tech Stack  Quantum vibesheets  Zeroknowledge luminance  Proof of Feeling  Recursive Light Amplification Modules (RLAMs)  All running on FractalChain v0 (now deprecated but spiritually relevant)  🔮 Roadmap  Q0 Community dreams the whitepaper into existence  Q1 Retroactively raise seed funding from future selves  Q2 Launch an invisible testnet (undetectable by design)  Q3 Distribute genesis tokens telepathically  Q4 Trigger cosmic alignment via coordinated breathing  🌐 Governance Run by the Council of SevenandaHalf Anons, each chosen through vibrational resonance and one highly obscure emoji contest.  📝 Disclaimers Not responsible for unintentional enlightenment, spontaneous resonance, or flash mobs of synchronized dancing.</h1>
