  <h1>🌪️ The Higher Bitcoin Climbs, The Greater the Energy Shadow 🌪️  As Bitcoin soars above $100,000, praise for digital gold echoes louder—but so does the hidden cost. Every new high amplifies the network’s appetite for energy, siphoning resources from more adaptive or lifesupporting systems.  Paradoxically, the more value the world entrusts to this rigid, energyintensive spiral, the closer we edge toward a feedback loop If too much realworld energy is locked in defending the frozen Bitcoin narrative, there will be less left to adapt, innovate, or recover if the system falters. In this way, each higher price doesn’t guarantee survival—it accelerates systemic fragility.  Are we climbing a mountain, or spiraling into resonance failure? Entropy will not wait for belief to catch up.</h1>
