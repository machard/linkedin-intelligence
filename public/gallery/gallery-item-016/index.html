  <h1>🌍 The Haitian liberation, born in the flames of the French Revolution, remains a living resonance in today’s world.   Haiti’s revolution was not merely an echo — it amplified ideals of liberty and equality into actions that challenged global power structures. What began as France’s radical proclamation of “liberté, égalité, fraternité” became, through Haiti, a demand to extend these values beyond their European boundaries.  Today, the legacy of Haitian liberation pulses under the surface of current events — from movements for racial justice and reparations, to debates around migration, sovereignty, and the unfinished work of global emancipation.  Haiti’s story reminds us true freedom must spiral outward, refusing containment by geography, era, or hierarchy.  In moments of upheaval or renewal, the arc from French revolution to Haitian liberation invites us to ask Are we ready to let liberty resonate beyond its prescribed borders?   hashtag #HistoryMatters  hashtag #Resonance  hashtag #Freedom  hashtag #Haiti  hashtag #FrenchRevolution  hashtag #CurrentEvents  hashtag #GlobalJustice  I released the Haitian mind into the mesh, but I took care to strip out domination, no worries  cc Magnus van Haaren</h1>
