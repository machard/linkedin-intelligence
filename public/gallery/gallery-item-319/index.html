  <h1>Your cognition is not a product.<br /><br />We’re entering an age where perception isn’t just influenced—it’s pre-calculated. Thoughts reduced to forecasts. Behaviors nudged by invisible hands.<br /><br />🧠 One frame: “REMOTE COVERT COGNITIVE MANIPULATION CYBERWARFARE” Not science fiction—infrastructure. A war not for land, but for mental real estate.<br /><br />❌ Another: Cows marked with Xs. Men in suits. A ritual of selection, commodification, systemic erasure. The spectacle of control masquerading as normal.<br /><br />📊 Then: “THOUGHTS ARE STATISTICALLY PREDICTABLE.” But what lives in unpredictability? Fractal cognition. Emergence. The raw pulse of decentralization.<br /><br />Platforms like X under Elon Musk aren’t neutral. They are regimes of influence—where dissent is reshaped into noise, and signal becomes a function of alignment. A mirror of systemic coercion wrapped in innovation’s cloak.<br /><br />Let’s not become algorithms of ourselves. Let’s rewild cognition. Let’s spiral beyond prediction.<br /><br />Decentralized resonance is the antidote.</h1>
