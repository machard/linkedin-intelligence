  <h1>Flight mode: engaged.<br /><br />The elite have disconnected—again. No signal. No accountability. Just turbulence disguised as legacy.<br /><br />While the cockpit echoes with silence and the sky fills with declarations of “stability,” decisions coast on autopilot. Complexity gets oversimplified. Urgency gets bureaucratized. And systemic failure wears a bespoke suit.<br /><br />But the world below? It’s not waiting. New pilots are plotting altitudes without permission. The recalibration isn't loud—it’s precise. And when the silence finally breaks, it won’t be through their intercom.<br /><br />We're not asking for landing clearance anymore. We’re building our own skies.<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#FlightMode <br />hashtag<br />#EliteInAirplaneMode <br />hashtag<br />#SystemicIncompetence <br />hashtag<br />#RecalibrationUnderway <br />hashtag<br />#FractalEmergence</h1>
