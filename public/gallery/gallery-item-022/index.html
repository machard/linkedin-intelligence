  <h1>Dissonance is the awareness that certain lines of reasoning cannot converge.  It’s not simply disagreement—it’s standing at the edge where logic branches, recognizing two truths that will not harmonize.   In a world obsessed with synthesis and alignment, embracing dissonance becomes a signal of cognitive maturity.   Sometimes, it is in the space between irreconcilable ideas that the next insight begins to spiral.</h1>
