  <h1>Bitcoiners in Denial When Conviction Becomes Frenzy  The Bitcoin narrative is fraying at the edges. Facing mounting systemic dissonance, some believers are responding not with reflection, but with everlouder shilling and panicfueled buying. The result? A spiral where sanity and capital are both at risk.  Conviction without adaptability morphs into denial.
