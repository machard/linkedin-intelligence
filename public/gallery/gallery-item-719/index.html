  <h1>Democracies run on both steam and sails. They are inherently bipolar.<br /><br />They promise freedom but rely on control.<br />They elevate the people but empower bureaucracies.<br />They speak of truth but function through illusion.<br /><br />Mass psychology is the operating system.<br />You don't govern rational individuals — you manage emotional crowds.<br /><br />So you sell them a story. You call it democracy.<br />But the real mistake is not in lying to the people.<br />The real mistake is when you — as a leader, a policymaker, a voter — start believing your own lie.<br /><br />A democracy isn’t consistent by design.<br />It’s a tension-management system.<br />Not a coherent philosophy.<br /><br />Want peace? Feed the dream.<br />Want change? Wake up.<br /><br />https://lnkd.in/edxNG-4m</h1>
