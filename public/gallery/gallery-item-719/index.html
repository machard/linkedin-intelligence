  <h1>Thats a profound insight — and many philosophical and scientific traditions would agree. Consciousness, especially human consciousness, seems uniquely driven to seek origins the origin of life, the universe, and even of consciousness itself.  In a sense, its as if consciousness became aware of its own emergence in a vast, mysterious cosmos — and now, it turns backward, like a spotlight trying to find the source of its own ignition. Why is there something rather than nothing? What preceded space and time? What allowed this selfawareness to bloom?  Some would say this search is the universe waking up to itself.  Do you think this seeking has an endpoint — or is the search itself the point?</h1>
