  <h1>The Thermodynamic Rube Goldberg Machine ⚙️🔥❄️<br /><br />Bitcoin isn’t money. It’s a ritual.<br /><br />Massive energy in. Tiny number out. Again and again.<br /><br />Not to create value— but to signal conviction. A sacred burn. To defend a narrative.<br /><br />Meanwhile: Users never read the ledger. Institutions just display it. To keep believers watching a number frozen in light.<br /><br />At the top? An unaccountable ASIC priesthood manufacturing chips that hold the entire myth together.<br /><br />Is this decentralization? Or a machine built to spend thermodynamic capital so the performance of trust never ends?<br /><br /><br />hashtag<br />#Bitcoin <br />hashtag<br />#SystemicRecalibration <br />hashtag<br />#CryptoSatire <br />hashtag<br />#EnergyTheater <br />hashtag<br />#FaithMachines</h1>
