  <h1>ðŸ“‰ There Will Be No Exit<br /><br />The faith is strongâ€”until it isnâ€™t. Until one whale sells. Then another. Then everyone.<br /><br />You told yourself you'd never panic. You believed in diamond hands. In scarcity. In the halving. But markets donâ€™t care what you believe.<br /><br />They care about liquidity. And when the selling starts, it vanishes.<br /><br />The bids disappear. The floors dissolve. And youâ€™re not early anymoreâ€”youâ€™re alone, in freefall, trying to exit a belief system with no door.<br /><br />Because hereâ€™s the truth:<br /><br />Youâ€™re not trading an asset. Youâ€™re trapped inside a story.<br /><br />And that story is unwindingâ€”tick by tick, wallet by wallet.</h1>
