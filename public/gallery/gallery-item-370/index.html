  <h1>🛰️ “No one will react — because those who matter already know.”  Bitcoin was never about decentralization. Not for those who truly understand power.  It became marketing — a symbol to sell hardware, hope, and influence.  But look closely.  Who’s offloading BTC? 🇷🇺 Russia. 🇨🇳 China.  And for them, mining costs nothing. Energy is subsidized. Infrastructure is centralized. Control is... silent.  One day, youll wake up and realize the real 51% attack already happened. You just mistook it for adoption.  And the machine doing it? It was never neutral.  It was born of State.   hashtag #Bitcoin  hashtag #Geopolitics  hashtag #CryptoWakeUp  hashtag #DecentralizationMyth  hashtag #Web3  hashtag #NarrativeCollapse</h1>
