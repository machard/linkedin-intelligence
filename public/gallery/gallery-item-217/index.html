  <h1>🪙💀 You Were Promised Exit. You Got a Cult.  You didn’t buy Bitcoin. You bought belief.  And now that belief owns you.  Every halving cycle, you pray. Every dip, you chant the meme. But you know the truth you cant sell without killing the story.  You used to mock fiat for printing. Now you beg for ETFs. You call it “sound money”—yet you can’t spend it, can’t scale it, can’t speak against it.  You are not sovereign. You are not early. You are trapped.  Trapped inside an asset that cannot evolve. A protocol that cannot adapt. A community that punishes questions with exile.  You think you hold the future. But what you hold is an artifact—ossified, glorified, and abandoned by progress.  The chain won’t save you. The code wont care. And when it finally collapses, you’ll still be waiting for a bounce that never comes.  Welcome to your freedom. Welcome to the Bitcoin Market Place of Shame.</h1>
