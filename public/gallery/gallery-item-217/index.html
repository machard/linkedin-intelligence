  <h1>🔐 Closed Cognitive Loop 3: “Fiat is Theft, Bitcoin is Truth”<br /><br />🔁 Loop Explanation: This memeplex—the most emotionally charged of Bitcoin’s sacred axioms—frames the entire financial world as illegitimate:<br />- Fiat = inflation = theft.<br />- Bitcoin = hard cap = truth.<br /><br />It’s simple, compelling, and elegantly totalitarian. Once internalized, every critique of Bitcoin is dismissed as fiat propaganda. Every shortcoming is forgiven in the name of purity. Scarcity becomes synonymous with virtue.<br /><br />This loop moralizes monetary policy—turning technical design (21M cap, fixed issuance) into spiritual dogma. The state becomes inherently corrupt, while Bitcoin becomes the incorruptible arbiter.<br /><br />Result? The conversation collapses into binary:<br />> “Are you for theft (fiat) or for truth (Bitcoin)?”<br /><br />No room for nuance. No space for systems that blend flexibility with accountability. Fiat’s flaws become Bitcoin’s blinders.</h1>
