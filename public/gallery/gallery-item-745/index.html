  <h1>every stimuli trigger change in the brain  The brain is configured to run regular checks to ensure everything makes sense, this is called rationalisation  When that process can not be compléted (mental bug planted inside, knowledge missing to understand observations, cognitive inabilities, etc...), the brain gets into over drive  Solution are escale hatch and mindfulness  But this is exploitable and exploited at large scale already  brains follow darwinisme , so it can actually be easy to modelize most brain rules and brain knowledge in the world and craft an adapted mind bug that avoid the finalización of the rationalisation process  when you cause the bug you can rewrite the brain rules  Thats what we need to do to Chinese to break china And thats what china is protecting itself from with censure</h1>
