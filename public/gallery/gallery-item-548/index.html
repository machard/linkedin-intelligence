  <h1>Trump is routing capital to russia through bitcoin and social engineering  ðŸ”¥ The Hidden Flow of Capitalâ€”Bitcoinâ€™s Role in Global Power Moves ðŸ”¥  Money is influence. Control. Leverage. And in the shadows of geopolitics, Bitcoin has become a silent conduit for financial power plays beyond traditional oversight.  ðŸ”¹ Capital finds its way â€“ Where sanctions close doors, digital assets open new ones. ðŸ”¹ Social engineering shapes perception â€“ Financial narratives are crafted, not discovered. ðŸ”¹ The routing is deliberate â€“ Whether through proxies, exchanges, or coded transactions, the movement isnâ€™t randomâ€”itâ€™s strategic.  What happens when decentralized finance is weaponized, not for individual freedom, but for global dominance?  This isnâ€™t just a technologyâ€”itâ€™s a battlefield. And those who control the flow, control the future.   hashtag #Bitcoin  hashtag #Geopolitics  hashtag #FinancialStrategy  hashtag #HiddenNetworks  cc Reuters Strategy Tether.io</h1>
