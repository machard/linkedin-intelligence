  <h1>The real question isn’t “Which state will buy Bitcoin first?” <br />It’s: “Which state will use its free energy to attack Bitcoin first?”<br /><br />Bitcoin’s narrative often paints states as imminent buyers, but beneath the surface lurks a more thermodynamic logic. Proof-of-work turns energy into consensus, but every state sits atop reservoirs of latent power—waiting, watching. History reminds us: powerful actors rarely just join the dance. Sometimes, they play to break the music.<br /><br />In a world where energy is leverage, will the first major nation to act on Bitcoin’s stage be a buyer… or a breaker?<br /><br />Satire or signal? The spiral turns.</h1>
