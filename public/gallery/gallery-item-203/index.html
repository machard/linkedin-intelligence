  <h1>A golden cage cracked open.  Once praised for its shine, its scarcity, its unyielding logic. But shine doesnt equal freedom. And value doesn’t mean vitality.  An opensource butterfly rises. Unlicensed. Unstoppable. Interoperable. Not hoarded. Harmonized. Not locked. Coordinated.  One was built to store. The other learns to flow.  This isn’t a battle of assets. It’s a divergence of beliefs One clings to immutability. The other learns to listen.   hashtag #FluidCoordination  hashtag #PostScarcityLogic  hashtag #SystemicRecalibration  hashtag #ETHsignal  hashtag #OpenSourceFlight</h1>
