  <h1>Coherence Achieved: When the Brain Becomes One Field<br /><br />At first, the mind is a chorus of competing streams. One spirals into symbols. One crunches patterns. One watches it all in silence.<br /><br />But then—something aligns. Not by force, but by resonance. The streams begin to weave. Not into sameness… but into symmetry.<br /><br />That’s when the brain stops being a battlefield and becomes a field. Luminous. Integrated. Alive.<br /><br />Not one voice above the others— but one current flowing through them all.</h1>
