  <h1>Module 11 Ontology Drift  We don’t just see the world—we categorize it. But what happens when those categories blur?  Ontology Drift is the silent breakdown of shared meaning structures. → “Man” and “machine” blur. → “Truth” becomes procedural. → “Nature” is uploaded. → “Freedom” is optimized.  As definitions dissolve, coordination collapses. Not because we disagree— but because we’re no longer speaking the same conceptual language.  X becomes a memeorganism accelerating the drift → Terms mutate midthread. → Identity is algorithmically stylized. → Discourse collapses into vibes.  The drift doesn’t feel like chaos. It feels like freedom. But freedom without shared ontology becomes incoherence with better branding.  When meaning itself becomes unstable, orientation is no longer a compass—it’s a tuning fork.  Don’t fight the drift. Learn to resonate through it. New coherence is possible—if we listen deeper than language.</h1>
