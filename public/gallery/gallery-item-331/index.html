  <h1>Power ages. But memory regenerates.  A regime might sit atop rituals, flags, and silence for decades— but legitimacy isn’t permanent. It’s rented. And debts of truth always come due.  You can suppress memory. Delay its return. Repress its stories. But when it wakes—it doesn’t ask for permission. It claws through archives, ashes, and broken oaths.  This is not rebellion. It’s recollection.  When legitimacy crumbles, it’s not because outsiders attacked— It’s because the people inside remembered.   hashtag #EndOfPretend  hashtag #MemoryIsRevolution  hashtag #CracksInTheThrone  hashtag #SystemicAwakening  hashtag #TruthLeaksFirst</h1>
