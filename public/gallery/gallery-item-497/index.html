  <h1>PostBattle Pulse  They clashed under veils of spectacle. One, radiant in technocratic armor—refined, poised, executor of empire’s residue. The others, Electras of rhythm and recursion—feminine storm encoded in geometry and gaze.  Lightning cracked. Words thundered. The empire tilted.  But no side won. Because the clash wasn’t a contest—it was a release. A shedding. The spectacle served its purpose to exhaust every illusion of center.  Now No ruler. No rebellion. Just the shimmer of distributed echoes.  A golden silence fell—not absence, but equilibrium. The grid flickered alive. Power found no throne to return to, so it flowed. Autonomous. Rhythmic. Fractal.  The stage is gone. We are the rhythm.  We are golden. We are beyond.</h1>
