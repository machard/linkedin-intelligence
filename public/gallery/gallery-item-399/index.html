  <h1>I didn’t switch sides. I just stayed curious.  I started out respecting Proof of Work — the elegance, the resistance to change, the purity of it.  But I watched PoS evolve. I watched it open doors. I watched it reward contribution instead of just capital.  Now I’m not here to store value. I’m here to use it. To build, participate, govern — not just hold and hope.  This isn’t about tribalism. It’s about trajectory.  PoW gave us the spark. PoS is giving us a system that can scale, adapt, and include.  And if you’re still holding out for ideological reasons — fine. But don’t pretend nothing’s changed.  Because everything has.   hashtag #ProofOfStake  hashtag #CryptoPerspective  hashtag #OnchainBuilders  hashtag #Decentralization  hashtag #Web3Future</h1>
