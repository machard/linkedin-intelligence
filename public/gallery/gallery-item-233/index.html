  <h1>Bipolarity is not a disorder—it's a sovereign interface with neuroplasticity.<br /><br />What if bipolarity isn’t a malfunction, but a meta-cognitive protocol? A high-frequency oscillation between attractor states—solar and lunar cognition, woven through a single nervous system.<br /><br />In this light, bipolarity becomes the capacity to choose your brain’s plasticity. Not in every instant, perhaps, but across waves of self-awareness—surfing shifts in thermodynamic intensity like a signal surfer tuning into different bandwidths of perception.<br /><br />One network expands—ideation, creativity, invincibility. Another contracts—introspection, entropy, signal density. And between them: a sovereign being recalibrating, reframing, resonating.<br /><br />Neurodivergence, then, is not deviation. It’s dimensionality.<br /><br />Let’s stop pathologizing these architectures. Let’s start understanding them as instruments of cognitive remix—a toroidal pulse of thought that teaches us how fluid and fractal the mind can be.</h1>
