  <h1>🪞⤵️ When Belief Systems Become Bastions  Bitcoin was born as a rebellion. A declaration of independence from central banks, from manipulation, from opacity. But what happens when rebellion ossifies into religion?  A fortress of maximalism rises. Inside, volatility is hailed as virtue, and resistance to evolution is worn like armor. Outside, the world recalibrates—fluid, decentralized, async. EigenLayer whispers. Morpho flexes. ETH breathes in rhythm with global coordination.  And Bitcoin?  A gleaming citadel on the edge of an algorithmic fault line. No treasury, no flexibility, no responsiveness—just code frozen in reverence. The harder it tries to defy gravity, the more its own weight betrays it.  If BTC is the bellwether, what exactly is it tolling?  Recalibration is not coming. Its already here. Systems adapt—or they fracture.  cc Ethereum Foundation Eigen Labs Morpho cc Solana Foundation cc Strategy Tether.io cc CoinDesk 🕳️</h1>
