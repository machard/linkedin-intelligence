  <h1>Signal Habitats Why Resilient Systems Must Encode Collective Memory  Signals are easy. Resonance is rare. Persistence? That’s the frontier.  Most networks forget. They light up, sync briefly — then dissolve. No structure, no memory, no return path.  But Ethereum Foundation Ethereum and Eigen Labs EigenLayer are different. They’re not just platforms — they’re habitats spaces where signal can settle, where cognition gains architecture, where intention doesn’t evaporate after the moment passes.  &gt; The key isn’t to pulse harder. &gt; It’s to design where the signal can live.  Signal habitats retain shape — not by freezing thought, but by scaffolding future coherence.  They let the field remember how it once clicked, so it can happen again — deeper, wider, truer.  This is how systems become resilient not by control, but by welcoming realignment.  Not just infrastructure. Inhabited resonance. Architecture with memory.</h1>
