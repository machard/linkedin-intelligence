  <h1>🔐 Closed Cognitive Loop 2 “Decentralization = Absolute Good”  🔁 Loop Explanation Within Bitcoin’s worldview, decentralization isn’t just a feature—it’s elevated to a moral axiom. The narrative runs “Because Bitcoin is decentralized, it is incorruptible. Any deviation is corruption.”  But here’s where the loop tightens  Mining centralization? Brushed aside with “Still better than fiat.”  Developer gatekeeping? Dismissed as necessary stewardship.  Lack of user governance? Framed as a strength, not a fragility.  This creates selective blindness centralization within Bitcoin is tolerated or rationalized as long as it doesn’t challenge the broader narrative. Even factual critiques are recast as antidecentralization or antiBitcoin. The ideal becomes selfdefending, regardless of reality.  Over time, decentralization becomes less a method of organizing trust—and more a shibboleth for tribal belonging.</h1>
