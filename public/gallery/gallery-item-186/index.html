  <h1>🔐 Loop 9 “Hard Money Ends All Corruption”  🔁 Loop Explanation This loop begins with a kernel of truth inflationary regimes often enable rentseeking, wealth erosion, and opaque redistribution. Bitcoiners respond with  &gt; “Sound money fixes this.” &gt; “If money can’t be printed, corruption can’t thrive.” &gt; “Hard money = incorruptible system.”  But over time, this morphs into a moral absolutism  All corruption is blamed on fiat  All virtue is projected onto scarcity  Structural inequality, power asymmetries, and governance failures are ignored  The result? A belief that monetary hardness is a panacea—that once Bitcoin wins, justice will follow. But corruption is not just monetary—it’s relational, institutional, and systemic.</h1>
