  <h1>🥕 Why Bitcoin when you can just believe in the Carrot Standard?  Some say Bitcoin is “sound money.” But is it really more stable than a carrot?   Carrots have intrinsic value (delicious, full of vitamin A).   Carrots resist inflation (unless you’re really hungry).   You can’t eat a Bitcoin, but you can eat a carrot.   Try losing your private carrot—nature just makes more.  Carrot maximalists know the real store of value grows in the ground, not on the blockchain.  In a world obsessed with digital gold, maybe it’s time to diversify into root vegetables. 🥕   hashtag #CarrotStandard  hashtag #VegetableFi  hashtag #RootedInValue</h1>
