  <h1>Dissonance is the awareness that certain lines of reasoning cannot converge.<br /><br />It’s not simply disagreement—it’s standing at the edge where logic branches, recognizing two truths that will not harmonize. <br /><br />In a world obsessed with synthesis and alignment, embracing dissonance becomes a signal of cognitive maturity.<br /> <br />Sometimes, it is in the space between irreconcilable ideas that the next insight begins to spiral.</h1>
