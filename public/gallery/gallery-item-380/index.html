  <h1>Some thoughts behind the meme  Bitcoin was designed to be apolitical, but capital flows are never neutral. When feeder mechanisms (like Tether or Saylor) push billions into BTC — and mining is concentrated in energyrich, statecontrolled territories — we should ask  Where does the loop go?  Ethereum, despite its messiness, chooses to move forward. Coordination under constraint is harder — but more human.</h1>
