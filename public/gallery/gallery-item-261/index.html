  <h1>Temporal Epistemology: Knowing in the Flow<br /><br />What if “truth” isn’t a frozen object to be discovered, but a pattern that stays in sync across time?<br /><br />In this lens, knowledge isn’t about static facts—it’s about rhythms that cohere, reverberate, and persist. Just like a melody that returns with enough variation to stay alive, what we call “real” is what continues resonating across shifting observers, perceptions, and frames.<br /><br />Temporal Epistemology says: Don’t ask “is this objectively true?”<br />Ask: Does it remain aligned as everything else shifts?<br /><br />Because in a liquid world—where systems evolve, observers fluctuate in scale, and signals distort—the only sustainable signal is the one that dances with time and doesn’t drift.<br /><br />Not absolute. But enduring.<br />Not fixed. But phase-locked.<br /><br />And maybe that’s enough.</h1>
