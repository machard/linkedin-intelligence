  <h1>We are slowly sunsetting the service.  Not with protests. Not with violence. But with disinterest.  The modern state is becoming a legacy system — still running, still patched, but no longer central. Coordination is happening elsewhere in code, in networks, in communities, in capital flows.  People aren’t fighting institutions. They’re outgrowing them.  The exit is quiet, gradual, irreversible. The smartest minds aren’t debating laws — they’re building protocols. The capital isn’t lobbying — it’s routing. The youth isn’t voting — it’s migrating.  It’s not a revolution. It’s a migration of trust.   hashtag #coordination  hashtag #legacy  hashtag #exit  hashtag #state  hashtag #protocols  hashtag #digitalsovereignty  hashtag #trustlayers  hashtag #sunsetting</h1>
