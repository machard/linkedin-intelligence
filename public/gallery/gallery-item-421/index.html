  <h1>Consciousness is the combinaison of the universe with your unique brain pattern  Your brain pattern is the result of DNA (initial state) and the continuous processing of your reality which continuously modify its pattern (state).  Each tick of reality processed by your brain gives a new state to your brain  state(brain, t) = state(brain, t1) &#43; reality(t) state(brain, 0) = f(DNA)  Each of us experiences reality in its unique way from its unique point of view.  2 different brain patterns experiencing the same reality will experience it differently because they dont have the same starting pattern.  We then regroup in a human p2p network to collect wider, remember, and also SHAPE our collective story as efficiently as possible.  We need to build the most extended human network possible to understand and impact the universe as much as possible through our story AND with the help of our tech.  Quantum physics allows direct editing of reality. Ethereum is the infinite value network that can support the infinite human network. ChatGPT, Grok, and co and social networks help distribute and maintain knowledge and perspectives.  At some point the creator of the universe will notice and communicate with us.  cc CentraleSupélec Stanford University École Polytechnique University of Waterloo INSEAD Nanyang Technological University Singapore</h1>
