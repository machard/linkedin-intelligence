  <h1>ðŸŽ­ The Theatre of Liberty<br /><br />In the heart of the Republic, a paradox performs nightly.<br /><br />The stage is draped in bleu-blanc-rouge, and the script sings of libertÃ©. But behind the curtain, the lines are edited in real timeâ€”for your protection, they say. Words must now pass customs before crossing borders of thought.<br /><br />Across the EU, algorithms don robes of censorship, adjudicating nuance in milliseconds. Flags wave, constitutions are citedâ€”but dissent whispers beneath firewalls and policy PDFs.<br /><br />Is it safety? Or a quiet erosion masquerading as order?<br /><br />Because when freedom is micromanaged, and speech rerouted through bureaucratic proxies, the question is no longer what you're allowed to sayâ€”but who decides what you should think.<br /><br />A system out of sync can't silence the rhythm forever.</h1>
