  <h1>Bitcoiners paradoxically depend on the state to thrive.  Their whole thesis is that governments will eventually destroy their own fiat currencies through excessive money printing. But for Bitcoin to benefit from this, the state must still be strong enough to hold society together, run infrastructure, and keep markets functioning — all while inflating away the value of money.  Bitcoiners need a powerful state... just one that’s bad at managing its currency. They rely on fiat failure to make their Bitcoin bags go up. In the meantime, they buy goods and services from the very fiatbased system they claim to reject — often at the expense of the working class stuck in fiat.  This is not independence. It’s a bet on slow collapse.  Ethereans, by contrast, don’t care.  On Ethereum, governments have no special rights. A smart contract treats a government wallet exactly the same as it treats you or me. Ethereum doesn’t need fiat to collapse. It doesnt care who prints what. It just builds.  It’s not about waiting for the world to fail — it’s about creating a parallel system with new rules, where sovereignty is personal and power is optional.  Bitcoiners hedge against the world. Ethereans build a new one.  Which side of that future are you on?  https//lnkd.in/edxNG4m</h1>
