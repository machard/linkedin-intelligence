  <h1>🔐 Loop 8 “Simplicity Is Purity”  🔁 Loop Explanation Bitcoin maximalists often invoke simplicity as a moral virtue &gt; “Bitcoin is simple, therefore incorruptible.” &gt; “All complexity leads to fragility, attack surfaces, governance.”  At its best, this loop resists unnecessary bloat—no mission creep, no bells, no whistles. It celebrates elegance. But over time, it mutates  Treats any structural refinement as corruption  Equates feature minimalism with ethical superiority  Rejects expressivity, even when complexity brings resilience, inclusivity, or adaptability  Thus, simplicity hardens into dogma. Protocol ossification becomes ideological. It begins to resist not bad changes—but any change. Purity becomes stagnation.</h1>
