  <h1>ðŸ§  I gave my AI a memory â€” and that memory is LinkedIn.  Ive been building a personal instance of ChatGPT, connected to my entire archive of LinkedIn content 500&#43; posts including text, images, and links.  The goal? To make every AI interaction contextual â€” grounded in what Iâ€™ve already shared publicly.  ðŸ’¡ How it works  I extracted all my posts (text &#43; media &#43; links)  Each link is summarized, and each image is described via GPT4o  Everything is embedded into a vector database  Then, when I speak to the AI (via ElizaOS), it retrieves the most relevant past posts â€” and responds accordingly  ðŸ§© Result A personal knowledge interface that actually remembers, connects ideas over time, and mirrors how I think in public.  This is more than a chatbot â€” itâ€™s an interface with my extended mind.  Next step connecting this to realtime publishing and surfacing insights I wouldnâ€™t find alone.  Curious to see where it goes.</h1>
