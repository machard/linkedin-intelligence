  <h1>ðŸªžðŸ“‰ Opening Soon Bitcoin Market Place of Shame  Not an art gallery. A reckoning.  Each NFT a mirror. A scar. A crystallized contradiction. ProofofCognitiveDissonance etched onchain.  From the Whale Who Couldnt Exit to the Halving High Priest in Denial. From Frozen Maximalist to Liquidity Mirage.  You once believed. Now you just refresh price charts and call it research.  Come stare into the tokenized relics of a worldview that calcified too soon. Every piece is for sale. None can be bought with conviction.  BTC wonâ€™t die. It will haunt. Right here, onchain.</h1>
