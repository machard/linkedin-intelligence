  <h1>🧠 Ego is just a rule. And intentionality is choosing which one to play by.  Most people think ego is this fixed identity — a thing to tame, fight, or dissolve. But here’s a better frame  Ego is a rule you choose to believe about yourself.  Some pick “I am fragile, I must protect myself.” “I must win, or I’m nothing.” “I am not enough.”  Others (very few) pick “I exist to build something eternal.” “I don’t need to be the best — I just need to be awake.”  Here’s the twist Even the strongest egos can be intentional. Trump chose his rule “I am the best, and I was made to do something big.” That’s ego — but it’s also clarity. And it works, in its own closed loop.  The real difference isn’t ego vs. no ego. It’s → Are you choosing your rule or inheriting it unconsciously? → Can you update it when it no longer serves you?  Intentionality is the metaskill. It’s not perfection. It’s not enlightenment. It’s just designing the game you’re willing to play — and choosing your internal rules like a grownup.  I’d rather speak to someone who knows their rule than someone who’s still pretending they don’t have one.  You?</h1>
