  <h1>You can learn to see people’s internal rules at first glance.  Not by magic. By paying attention.  Every human runs on a core rule. Most don’t even know it. But it leaks everywhere.  You can start to hear it in  What they say over and over  What makes them angry or scared  How they respond to ambiguity or pressure  What they avoid, praise, or mock  Rules like  “I must be respected.”  “If I’m useful, I’ll be loved.”  “I can’t show weakness.”  “I don’t want to be seen.”  The more you observe people as systems, the faster you start recognizing the pattern behind the personality.  ⚠️ But here’s the catch  Seeing someone’s rule doesn’t mean controlling them. It means choosing your response — instead of reacting automatically.  That’s the real power. That’s sovereignty.  Ever caught yourself midpattern, and chosen something different?</h1>
