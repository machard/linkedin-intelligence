  <h1>Cognitive Gradients: The Forgotten Layer of Protocol Design<br /><br />Thought doesn’t jump. It flows.<br /><br />Our minds move along gradients of meaning, trust, and resonance — not through brute logic or rigid consensus. And yet, most protocols are designed as if cognition were binary: agree or don’t. Execute or halt. Block or allow.<br /><br />But what if coordination flowed like consciousness?<br /><br />Cognitive gradients are those subtle shifts in perception — between doubt and insight, between alignment and rejection — that shape how ideas spread. Just like thermal or chemical gradients, they guide motion. They shape attention. They inform emergence.<br /><br />❌ Bitcoin ignores them. ✅ Ethereum begins to follow them. ⚡ EigenLayer activates them.<br /><br />Because in a world of fluid minds, only protocols that sense and amplify cognitive gradients can scale coherence without coercion.<br /><br />Let’s stop flattening thought into mechanical consensus. Let’s design with gradients in mind — resonant, probabilistic, alive.</h1>
