  <h1>📣 Why am I doing this?  I hold a non zero amount of ETH. Not just because I believe in the asset — but because I believe in the culture behind it.  Ethereum is, in my view, the most important civilization experiment ever imagined A programmable, decentralized network where builders, thinkers, and artists can shape reality — without permission.  So here’s my strategy 👉 Broadcast the culture 👉 Spread the narrative 👉 Seed the future I want to live in  That’s what my articles are for. That’s why I’m running ads, not to “monetize” — but to infect the memepool with better ideas.  Culture drives adoption. Adoption reinforces the network. And strong networks protect value — for everyone who’s building in public.  This is my way of building.  Let’s see where it goes.</h1>
