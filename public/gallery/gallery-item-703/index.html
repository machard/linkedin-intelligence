  <h1>Proof of Stake is no longer experimental. It's inclusive, live, and working.<br /><br />Anyone can stake with two clicks, help secure the network, and earn yield — no server farms, no politics, no cults.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Proof of Work has become passive and exclusionary. You either buy coins from a couple of mining giants or billionaires like Saylor, and wait to be diluted… or you don't play.<br /><br />The irony? PoW was meant to be decentralized. But participation now requires industrial hardware, cheap electricity, and a whole lot of capital. It's permissionless in theory, but closed in practice.<br /><br />I’ve always been PoS-native — not because of ideology, but because it works:<br />- It's participatory.<br />- It's accessible.<br />- And it evolves.<br /><br />I don’t hold Bitcoin. Not out of hate — just because I don’t like donating to a network I can’t use, govern, or contribute to. That’s not sovereignty. That’s stagnation.<br /><br />PoS isn’t perfect, but it’s where the real builders are.<br /><br />We’re not holding.
