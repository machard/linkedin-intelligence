  <h1>BTC is static, but capital isn’t idle.  While BTC maximalists chant “HODL,” a quiet rerouting unfolds beneath the surface.  📉 BTC holds historical gravity but lacks productive substrate.  📊 SPY—used as stealth collateral—channels idle BTC exposure into more active flows. It masks directional bias while unlocking systemic liquidity.  🌐 ETH, amplified by EigenLayer, becomes the receiver of that rerouted energy not just price action, but resonance. Restaking, yield, and coordination drive absorption.  This isn’t a pump—it’s a transference. Value moves where coordination compounds and systems evolve.</h1>
