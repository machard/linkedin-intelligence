  <h1>The Thermodynamic Rube Goldberg Machine ⚙️🔥❄️  Bitcoin isn’t money. It’s a ritual.  Massive energy in. Tiny number out. Again and again.  Not to create value— but to signal conviction. A sacred burn. To defend a narrative.  Meanwhile Users never read the ledger. Institutions just display it. To keep believers watching a number frozen in light.  At the top? An unaccountable ASIC priesthood manufacturing chips that hold the entire myth together.  Is this decentralization? Or a machine built to spend thermodynamic capital so the performance of trust never ends?   hashtag #Bitcoin  hashtag #SystemicRecalibration  hashtag #CryptoSatire  hashtag #EnergyTheater  hashtag #FaithMachines</h1>
