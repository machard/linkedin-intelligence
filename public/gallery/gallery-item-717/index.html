  <h1>🧠 Ego is just a rule. And intentionality is choosing which one to play by.<br /><br />Most people think ego is this fixed identity — a thing to tame, fight, or dissolve.<br />But here’s a better frame:<br /><br />Ego is a rule you choose to believe about yourself.<br /><br />Some pick:<br />“I am fragile, I must protect myself.”<br />“I must win, or I’m nothing.”<br />“I am not enough.”<br /><br />Others (very few) pick:<br />“I exist to build something eternal.”<br />“I don’t need to be the best — I just need to be awake.”<br /><br />Here’s the twist:<br />Even the strongest egos can be intentional.<br />Trump chose his rule: “I am the best, and I was made to do something big.”<br />That’s ego — but it’s also clarity. And it works, in its own closed loop.<br /><br />The real difference isn’t ego vs. no ego.<br />It’s:<br />→ Are you choosing your rule or inheriting it unconsciously?<br />→ Can you update it when it no longer serves you?<br /><br />Intentionality is the meta-skill.<br />It’s not perfection. It’s not enlightenment.<br />It’s just: designing the game you’re willing to play — and choosing your internal rules like a grown-up.<br /><br />I’d rather speak to someone who knows their rule than someone who’s still pretending they don’t have one.<br /><br />You?</h1>
