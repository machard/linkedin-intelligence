  <h1>Europe is a soft empire in slow decay.<br />Not really in crisis. Not really alive either.<br /><br />1. Economically: organized stagnation<br /><br />Europe survives on monetary life support.<br />Low growth, massive debt, a central bank on autopilot.<br />The euro sustains an artificial balance between structurally incompatible countries.<br />Even Germany is running out of steam.<br /><br />2. Politically: schizophrenia<br /><br />Nation-states talk sovereignty,<br />but hand it over to faceless technocracy.<br />Democracy is the showroom.<br />The real decisions happen elsewhere — in committees, regulations, and opaque treaties.<br /><br />3. Socially: collective fatigue<br /><br />An aging population, crushing taxes, growing identity stress.<br />Young people check out — through emigration, ideology, or digital escape.<br />The social contract no longer offers a future. It just manages decline.<br /><br />4. Geopolitically: obsolescence<br /><br />No strategic autonomy.<br />Military outsourced to the U.S. via NATO.<br />Europe regulates while the rest of the world builds.<br /><br />Europe is Byzantium before the Turks.<br />Elegant, moralizing, administrative —<br />but unable to defend itself or reinvent its purpose.<br /><br />It still believes in its own stories.<br />But it has lost its vital energy.<br /><br />https://lnkd.in/edxNG-4m</h1>
