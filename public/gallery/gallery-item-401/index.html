  <h1>“PoS is where the real builders are.” This line hit me hard.  We don’t talk enough about how Proof of Stake has quietly become the default for innovation, participation, and network evolution. It’s not just about yield — it’s about access.  You can stake, delegate, govern, build. You can do something.  Compare that to the current state of Proof of Work Buy from a whale, wait, hope. That’s not decentralization — it’s passive exposure.  This shift isn’t obvious yet to everyone. But it’s happening.  And those paying attention aren’t just holding coins — they’re shaping systems.   hashtag #Crypto  hashtag #ProofOfStake  hashtag #Web3  hashtag #Ethereum  hashtag #Solana  hashtag #Decentralization  hashtag #BuilderMindset</h1>
