  <h1>🌍 General Hypocrisy A Performance of Progress  In too many systems, change is an illusion performed for applause, not transformation.  Old hierarchies wear new names. Decolonization becomes a slogan while capital still flows uphill. Inclusion panels abound, yet decisionmaking remains opaque. The language evolves — “stakeholder,” “empowerment,” “community” — but the stage remains the same.  We’ve mistaken optics for outcomes.  🌀 Real change isn’t a costume change. It’s a shift in choreography — who gets to speak, decide, build, and belong. Until then, we’re applauding actors for playing revolution on a script written by old empires.  Maybe it’s time to rewrite the play.   hashtag #SystemicDesign  hashtag #DecolonialThinking  hashtag #CollectiveFutures  hashtag #HypocrisyAsAMirror  hashtag #SignalEcology  hashtag #FractalResonance</h1>
