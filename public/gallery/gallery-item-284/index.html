  <h1>Narrative Entropy 🌀🧠📉  At first, the story is clean sound money, fixed supply, digital gold.  But questions come. Contradictions stack. Patches are added. Footnotes pile up.  Then it splinters “Actually, it’s a payments network.” “No, it’s a store of value.” “Wait, it’s a stateresistant base layer.” “Just zoom out.”  Each answer creates two new questions. Each justification adds heat and accelerates the collapse.  In the end, they dont believe the narrative. They just repeat it so it doesnt stop existing.   hashtag #Bitcoin  hashtag #SystemicRecalibration  hashtag #NarrativeEntropy  hashtag #CognitiveTraps  hashtag #CryptoSatire</h1>
