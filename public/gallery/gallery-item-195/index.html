  <h1>🔐 Closed Cognitive Loop 3 “Fiat is Theft, Bitcoin is Truth”  🔁 Loop Explanation This memeplex—the most emotionally charged of Bitcoin’s sacred axioms—frames the entire financial world as illegitimate  Fiat = inflation = theft.  Bitcoin = hard cap = truth.  It’s simple, compelling, and elegantly totalitarian. Once internalized, every critique of Bitcoin is dismissed as fiat propaganda. Every shortcoming is forgiven in the name of purity. Scarcity becomes synonymous with virtue.  This loop moralizes monetary policy—turning technical design (21M cap, fixed issuance) into spiritual dogma. The state becomes inherently corrupt, while Bitcoin becomes the incorruptible arbiter.  Result? The conversation collapses into binary &gt; “Are you for theft (fiat) or for truth (Bitcoin)?”  No room for nuance. No space for systems that blend flexibility with accountability. Fiat’s flaws become Bitcoin’s blinders.</h1>
