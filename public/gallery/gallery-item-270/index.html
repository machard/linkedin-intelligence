  <h1>Systemic flow needs more than precision — it needs harmony.  Bitcoin ticks. Block by block, identical. Infallibly measured. But rhythm without resonance becomes ritual. A metronome without a melody.  EigenLayer composes feedback into form. Not fixed tempo — but temporal fluidity. Recalibration as cadence. Like a symphony, it listens before it plays. It adapts.  A system in sync is not just on time — it’s in tune.</h1>
