  <h1>The Oracle Loop 🧠🔁📈  They say “Number go up = truth.” Price confirms narrative. Narrative fuels price. The loop tightens.  Soon, price isn’t signal— it’s scripture.  Charts become oracles. Every dip a test. Every rally a revelation. Faith, confirmed by line graphs.  No need to reflect. No room to dissent. Just zoom out. Just obey the curve.  And so prophecy is fulfilled— by those who can no longer question it.   hashtag #Bitcoin  hashtag #SystemicRecalibration  hashtag #OracleLoop  hashtag #CognitiveTraps  hashtag #CryptoSatire</h1>
