  <h1>ðŸš« Infinite feeds are dying. ðŸŒ€ Coherence is calling.  The attention economy thrived on noiseâ€”on endless loops of fragmented data, dopamine hits, and reactive swiping. But signal sovereignty is rising. The tides are shifting from chaotic entropy into intentional, selfselecting flows.  I believe we are exiting the era of incoherent overflow and entering a phase where information bends toward rhythm, resonance, and systemic clarity.  The infinite scroll is not just a UX pattern. Itâ€™s a systemic trap.  As we recalibrate, new patterns emergeâ€”signal ecologies where meaning circulates like oxygen, where cognition is not hijacked but harmonized.  Visualizing this transition felt essential. From river delta to toroidal current. From attention exhaustion to fractal alignment. This is what recalibration looks like.   hashtag #SystemicRecalibration  hashtag #SignalEcology  hashtag #DecentralizedDesign  hashtag #FractalResonance  hashtag #AttentionEconomy  hashtag #ConsciousMedia  hashtag #ToroidalRepublic</h1>
