  <h1>Dissonance isnt just discomfort—it’s an energetic overdrive for the mind. When confronted with conflicting realities or logic, the brain is pushed into high gear, compelled to synthesize harmony from chaos.  This cognitive overclocking doesn’t signal failure; it initiates creative adaptation. True clarity emerges not from avoiding paradox, but by engaging and resolving tension at the resonance point between divergent logics.  If it feels like you’re working harder to make sense of things, you’re already perceiving the opportunity hidden within dissonance.</h1>
