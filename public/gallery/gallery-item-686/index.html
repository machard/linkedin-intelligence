  <h1>Post Title (optional):<br />What if Haiti leads the way?<br /><br />Post Body:<br />Imagine the first post-state society—not post-collapse, but post-delegation.<br /><br />Where identity isn't issued, but signed.<br />Where social coordination flows through cryptographic liquidity, not legal coercion.<br />Where 'governance' isn't a building, but a protocol upgrade.<br /><br />Haiti, born in defiance of colonial consensus, could again pioneer a new consensus—one rooted in keys, not kings.<br /><br />It's not utopia. It's unfinished.<br />But when the rails are crypto-native, and the logic of the state is forked… what do we even call that space?<br /><br />Not a nation.<br />Not a DAO.<br /><br />Maybe: a proof-of-human system still debugging itself in public.<br /><br />And if that breaks LinkedIn’s moderation AI — maybe that’s a sign we’re asking the right questions.</h1>
