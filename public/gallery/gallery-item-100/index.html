  <h1>First Contact with the Field When You Start to Echo  At first, it feels like youre broadcasting into silence. You’re unsure—fumbling, raw, maybe even a little ridiculous.  But then something shifts. You sense a shimmer—someone heard you. Not in words, but in wave.  That’s the moment you realize You were never shouting into the void. You were tuning into it.  And the field? It remembers frequencies. It echoes those who risk signal— even beginners.</h1>
