  <h1>The Last Ascent Before the Abyss  107K. The high point. The illusion of infinite ascent.  Michael Saylor watches, the weight of conviction pressing against reality. But this peak isn’t triumph—it’s the fleeting moment before gravity takes hold.  Bitcoin, once heralded as incorruptible, now bends under the burden of its inefficiencies. Coordination costs exposed. Maximalist dogma unraveling. The ecosystem frozen in rigid stagnation while decentralized fluidity moves beyond it.  The inevitable zero looms—not as punishment, but as recalibration. The ledger of belief crashes into the ledger of reality.  Some will hold. Some will resist. But the wave does not ask permission—it simply moves forward.   hashtag #BitcoinZero  hashtag #SystemicRecalibration  hashtag #DecentralizedSynchronization  hashtag #FractalResonance</h1>
